"Badly Written and Ill Conceived Science Fiction with a Few Interesting Ideas


I'm not sure I read the same book as everyone else. This got lots of four and five star reviews here on Goodreads.

Plus, it's been nominated for both Hugo and Nebula awards.

As often happens, I'm not with the majority opinion here. I give it two stars.

I'm not sure if the problem was the translation, or the original text, or both. (Unfortunately I only have the audio for this, so I can't quote the text here).

But I found the writing wooden, the characters two-dimensional cartoonish stick figures, and the audio narration poor. Although most of the characters are academics or intellectuals, the most believable and interesting character turns out to be a coarse and apparently ignorant policeman, She Qiang (nicknamed ""Da Shi"").

Most of the characters are cold and unsympathetic. A few of them commit murders for which they seem entirely unremorseful. It's impossible to care about these people.

And there are many unbelievable plot developments. For example, Mike Evans, an environmentalist, conveniently inherits his billionaire father's money at just the right time in the plot. I won't say much more about this as it's a spoiler.

This might have been acceptable in the early years of science fiction, but now it just seems like a bad novel.

As for the science...I'm not a physicist, so I can't really discuss the physics. Evidently, the three body problem has been unsolved by physicists dating back to Newton. So this part has some scientific basis.

Also, the stuff about micro circuitry was interesting.

But I have worked with computers for many years. The ""human formation computer"" (a computer powered by trained soldiers with colored flags) seems a bit silly to me, although nothing is impossible. I doubt if millions of humans could achieve the required precision. Interestingly, a minor character in the book who is an executive in a software company says the same thing.

Also, the author seems preoccupied with social status. And science is held up as an object of worship.

Science and technology are important, but I don't think they should be a religion (which in some quarters they seem to have become).

Anyway, here's a brief summary.

As a young girl, Ye Wenjie, an astrophysicist, witnesses the killing of her father by Cultural Revolution fanatics.

She becomes an astrophysicist herself and is recruited for a secret Chinese science/military project, Red Coast. It's years before she learns the true purpose of the project.

Meanwhile, many intellectuals are playing a video game (which requires a haptic suit), called ""The Three Body Problem"". The main gamer character, Wang Miao, is a professor of physics specializing in nanotech.

It turns out the game and the Red Coast project are connected.

They both relate to extraterrestrial life.










Anyway, I won't say much more about the story. I don't want to spoil it.

If you liked , you might enjoy this. The focus is technology and science, with the prose, characters, and plot being entirely secondary to the ideas. 's was another book where the characters and plot were subordinate to the ideas, although I think it works much better as a novel than this does.

I didn't really care for Luke Daniels' audio narration either. His voice varied from leaden in some spots to over-excited in others. And when doing foreign accents, he either exaggerated them, or in some cases, got them wrong.

I'd say pass on this one, except that lots of others seem to love it.

"I'm going to call it right now. Even though I only just finished book one, I'm certain The Three-Body Problem will go down as my favorite sci-fi series of all time.

This book blew my mind so thoroughly that it leaves only destruction in its wake. Where could Liu Cixin have possibly come up with all of these ideas and concepts? No wonder everyone says this is wildly imaginative. Even a single one of the ideas in here would have sufficed for a book of its own, but to put them all together into a single cohesive epic tale is absolutely jaw-dropping.

The pacing is relentless and the surprises just keep coming. In fact, it has more twists and turns than most mysteries and thrillers I've read. Not only is the story utterly riveting, but it's also insightful and thought-provoking, touching upon science, politics, philosophy, and history. I found myself glued to the pages. I wanted to inhale the story as fast as I could, but I had to slow myself down periodically to reread and fully absorb all that the book was trying to tell me.

This is my favorite type of science fiction, one that puts science front and center and unabashedly celebrates everything about it. There's no handwaving, no hocus pocus. Every point brought up is eventually explained via actual science in ways that made complete sense. And what ingenious explanations they are, sure to stun and amaze any reader.

I found the initial pages, set during the Cultural Revolution, to be enlightening. This was the defining event of my parents' generation, yet they hardly talk about it. How do you put into words the frenzy that overtook a whole country, such that science and learning were denounced, and friends turned on friends, neighbors turned on neighbors? It's like a fever burned through the population, and left famine, trauma, and destruction in its wake. This emotionally fraught experience influences all who went through it, including the characters in this book.

With translations, there's always the fear that some vital but intangible part of the story will be lost. And this is especially the case when the two languages in question do not share a common linguistic ancestor, so translating between them is not as simple as one-to-one. In the translator's notes at the end of the book, Ken Liu mentions that he was cognizant of this and tried hard to preserve not only the story, but also the cadence and feel of the Chinese language and culture in his translation. I think he did an excellent job.

One thing to note is that the official book blurb is quite short for this story, but in my opinion, even that gives away too much. This is a book best experienced blind, so if you're going to read it, don't look up anything about it ahead of time.

What a tremendous way to start the trilogy. My expectations for the remaining two books are sky high, and I'm assured by everyone I know who has already read them that they will be met and exceeded. I have no doubt only goodness awaits me.

"PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT

I just rated a book 5 stars.

Just read it.

**Update now that I've read the whole trilogy!**

This is now one of my all time favorite sci-fi series. The concepts are brilliant and I fear that I'll never find anything this mind-blowing.

With that said... the books are quite sexist (the first half of the first two books are quite slow and painful) but I still recommend them if you can stomach it.

They're incredibly science heavy but anyone interested in space and first contact with aliens needs to read this!

*After watching the show all I can say is... the characters were done so much better in it. Prepare yourself if you haven't read the books yet!*

"I'm really waffling between whether to rate ""did not like it"" vs. ""it was okay"" -- I very, very rarely give out one stars, and it feels uncharitable because it was a book I wanted to like more than I did, and I want more diverse SF, but... no. I've consciously created a ""not my cup of tea"" shelf for this very book, however, because a lot of people seem to have liked it. Is this what hard SF is like? In which case, it reminds me of similar ""I am completely unable to get interested in this"" problems I had with Kim Stanley Robinson last year.

I actually started this book months ago, but wasn't feeling it after the first chapter and stopped. I picked it up again now, stubbornly ploughing through because of the Hugos, and I kept waiting for it to suddenly turn around and wow me, but... it never did. At the 80% mark, I was still waiting.

Learning more about the Chinese Cultural Revolution was fascinating, and I liked seeing its colossal effects on Ye, plus the feeling of 'science will save us' that permeates the society. Liu Cixin's imagination of an alien society was really good and unique (dehydrate! dehydrate!).

Da Shi is, hands-down, the best character of this entire book. I much rather wanted to read his tales of fighting crime, with his seedy, no-bullshit, 'I'm not a cop, but I'm a great cop' approach. He livened up every scene he was in! Instead, this was so much like reading a physics textbook.

That's about where my praise ends, because I prefer emotional character-driven plots with some action, whereas this is a science-driven impersonal plod. Who the hell is Wang, our protagonist? After one single scene with his wife and son (!), they literally disappear for the rest of the book, and I couldn't tell you what his personality is like. He's just the viewfinder through which we see information unfold -- and unfold it does, with just reams and reams of exposition and info-dumps.

The prose is dull. I didn't so much mind it being stilted, and the dialogue carrying the remnants of its original language (a conscious effort on the translator Ken Liu's part), but it's just a trudging plod. I highlighted a few more poetic passages that I really liked, but for the most part it leans more to clinical and dry.

I liked the virtual reality chapters, but after all that buildup, I feel like it just fizzles out and absolutely, literally, nothing has been accomplished by the end of the book. With where the plot goes, the entire book honestly just feels like a prologue for the sequel.

I feel like the Goodreads blurb was pretty awfully off-base, touting that it has ""the scope of and the commercial action of "". I... what??? There is literally ONE action scene, it occurs about 90% through the book, and the characters aren't actively involved, just watching on from afar. And while the alien world/society is interestingly-written, it is nowhere near the scope of Dune.

Without characters with real depth to get attached to, I just never got hooked into this book. Ye has so much potential, but I feel like she wasn't fleshed out enough either -- people's more interesting psychological choices are left unplumbed/unexplored, meaning that I'm left with behaviour that I don't really buy, that doesn't seem natural for a human to do. Specifically:


The chronology and pacing is all over the place, too, hopping back and forth in time and as characters tell each other rambling stories. It's slow and sedate and takes forever to get anywhere -- the blurb trumps up
, but even that doesn't happen in the book at all, and indeed,
, so what in the world is the point of this story?

I mean, I get the point. I get that it's about humans pitted against humans, and the divisive cracks that can tear us apart even without the physical presence of an Other.

But man, I just couldn't bring myself to care. I'm so sorry, Cixin. I wanted to love it.

"A scientist is drawn into a conspiracy involving a computer game and an old research station and extra-terrestrial life.

Translated from the original Chinese. I have to admit I read this book mostly because the way it's being talked about made me really uncomfortable. There's the contingent who want to treat it as some sort of referendum on the Chinese science fiction landscape, or Chinese literature in general, as it was a wildly successful bestseller there. Yeah, okay, tell you what – go take a look at this week's bestseller list and pick out the book we should translate into other languages for readers to judge as a referendum on all of American writing of that genre. I'll wait. And then there's the way the translator responded to criticism by making a lot of sweeping statements about Chinese writing that I have very little doubt, even in the absence of any personal expertise, are dubious at best. This book is occupying some weird space in reviewerland, is what I'm saying.

So I read it, and. Um. It's not very good. Flat characters, some shall we say eyebrow raising decisions regarding women, a lot of , etc. Which kind of figures, since if notions of can be translated, then this book is Chinese Tom Clancy. So . . . there you go.

It did intrigue me on behalf of other Chinese science fiction, though. The cultural context of this story – the asides about how communism impacted intellectual thought, for example – interested me more than anything else.

I generally have a pretty good nose for these things, though, and I smell movie deal, for what that's worth.

Reread 2022 with extended review

Hostility towards science ruins everything
Ignorance and especially ideology fueled hate against science, and especially scientists who were torchbearers of the unwanted, enemy ideology are a certain way to ruin your world domination plans. No matter if Catholic church, the Nazis with their weird physics ( infodump, no required reading, and uchronia overkill: if they wouldn´t have been antisemitic, but instead anti communism, anti American capitalism, anti Muslim, etc., they would possibly have had the correct science to first build nuclear bombs. Because many people at the Manhatten project would have stayed in Germany) or, in this case, the Chinese. As soon as one bans certain science and doesn´t allow research, degeneration sets in, and keeping pace with more enlightened competitors becomes impossible. Cixin shows the historic examples and contrasts them with near future science, showing how far we came in such a short period of time thanks to the rise of science, relativizing the depressing beginning.

Epic, flowery language, which is unusual for the genre
First, this seems more like an extremely well written, average nonfiction novel, because the science comes slowly (but boy, how it finally comes), and all the metaphors and character fused and focused exposition make one as interested in the characters as in the story itself, which is amazing for a genre that often prioritizes plot and worldbuilding over protagonists. Especially towards the second half and end, this acceleration leads to a culmination of both style and world that is a rare, exceptional enjoyment in the genre.

Unique ideas
I can´t really mention much without spoilers, but this work has some mindboggling, ingenious ideas I´ve hardly ever seen in other sci-fi works, not even close. It may be Cixins´technical background that made him finetune such pearls of the genre into his work and, if I got it right, even added some innuendos to Chinese history and military tactics, although I am far from sure und too unknowing to definitively confirm that conjecture.

Drawing a (big) history picture of ones´ country
Some other authors, I am too lazy and procrastinating to remember and name them here, did already use the real, alternative, future, alternative past, etc history of their countries to give great edutainment lectures of the sociocultural, epigenetic evolution and that it could have been completely different, often just decided by one improbable random event, a prodigy inventing or discovering something, or a lunatic hate preacher made god king, leader, or elected democratic president, whatever the difference is. ( Personal opinion: It´s not as if voting all few years and having a work environment that´s just slavery with extra steps, and sometimes even free social services in Europe at least still, speaks of true sociocultural evolution. See freaking end of history drivel. It´s just less inhumane and politically correct, but it stayed a de facto dictatorship.) That´s not just entertaining, but a great way to learn more about foreign cultures too, especially with the subtle criticism and satirizing element sci-fi loves to add to everything in general and which makes it the best genre of them all.

Maybe a bit too hard for the beginning and average sci-fi reader
One prone to the genre and used or even in some theoretical concepts will enjoy it, for others it might be a bit too much, especially because so many protagonists are scientists too to make the infodumpy technobabble Elysium more credible and better and easier to plot. Skimming and scanning the theoretical, as in other less hard sci-fi works, isn´t a solution in this case too, because everything is so interconnected that one won´t get the whole picture anymore without it.

Old perspective before reading the whole trilogy:
Can´t wait to see how the other parts are, especially regarding its outstanding role in the genre
What I´ve heard, Cixin did an amazing job in connecting the whole trilogy, especially regarding the scientific, main tropes fueling this new milestone of the genre. With other of my favorite genre authors, whose perfect deliveries I do already know and love, this wouldn´t be so exciting, but because of the special, fresh taste of this first piece of orgiastic sci-fi nerdgasm, I am so looking forward to reading the next parts as unprepared and curious as I could be. And, without being narcissistic (again), this means something.

New view after having been enlightened and proselytized to just believe in the almighty Flying Spaghetti Monster:
This trilogy owns close to everything just aspiring to be a big sci fi we´re so small in comparison moment. If you can handle this epic triple, you´ll begin a never ending love affair with the best genre to rule, vivisect, and cosmic body horror them all.

Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:

"Re-read 1/30/24:

I got my special hardcover out and took my sweet time reading this. It's a favorite, to be sure, and I knew it before I started it now.

I mean, sure, I'm reading it because the Netflix adaptation is coming out rather soon, but MOSTLY, I just want to enjoy the OMG WHAT DID I JUST READ moments all over again.

Hard SF is absolutely my thing. Good or even great Hard SF is just too much for my poor heart. Good thing I know how to dehydrate just before I'm utterly dead. I'll be sure to come back during another Stable Season.

And yes, I'm muahahahahahaing about what I know will come in the full trilogy. No spoilers, but wow.



Original Review:

From the opening, I was struck by how much history I didn't know about China's Cultural Revolution. It might be obvious to anyone growing up in those parts, of course, but I was almost lost in that story long before I saw that there was anything sci-fi about the novel. This is a good thing. It speaks of good writing.

And then things changed. I became a frog in a pot. Small hints accumulate, surrounded by mathematical problems both fundamental and curious.

And then the MC's sanity is questioned. It's an open question that both the reader and the character must answer.

And then I got an idea. I could easily make the argument that all scientists in this novel are actually Main Characters, and indeed, that theory only becomes crystal clear later in the novel. It was a delight.

The novel is full of scientist suicides, damn odd hallucinations, all the way to a fantastic virtual reality game that draws intellectuals from around the world before devolving into a suggestive epic space opera featuring some of the most interesting aliens I've read about in a LONG time.

The worldbuilding is top-knotch-squared.

The clever uses of technology are the true highlights of the novel, and I'm upset. Why? Because the translations and publications for the next two novels are still in the future. Why am I still upset? Because I can hardly find the other works for this great author.

A grandmaster of Chinese sci-fi? I can't deny the fact. And just because I can't compare to other science fiction masters of Chinese literature is a null point. I am already a fanboy. I'll be revelling in every work I can get my hands on.

This is a fantastic example of how great science fiction can be. Truly inspiring.

Update.

This novel now a Hugo Nominee for 2015 because of the translation and introduction into the English-speaking market. It is a last minute replacement for Marco Kloos's Lines of Departure that was bravely self-removed due to the Sad Puppy 3 controversy. It wasn't his fault, and he got caught up in some seriously not-cool BS with this year's Hugo. He should be treated like any other Hugo Nominee. With respect and awe for the accomplishment it is, even though he withdrew.

On the other hand, after finding out that Three Body Problem took his place, I have to admit that it couldn't have happened to a better novel. I loved this one. It was really fantastic and it had everything I like to see in seriously good fiction.

This one might truly be my top pick for the year. It might be the one I cast my ballot on. But first, I need to read a few more Nominees. I take this very seriously. We bring our levels of joy and dedication to the ideas we thrive on. Awards are only as good as we make them. I refuse to let the Hugo become a quagmire.

Let the best novel win!

"The Three-Body Problem was the best SF novel that I’ve read so far. Admittedly, I did not read a lot of them. However, I can recognize when I encounter a special gem and this one definitely is unique in its world building. Moreover, it is very well written (and translated) which, unfortunately, it is not always the case with SF novels, especially with the classics.

The first chapters take place in the Chinese Cultural revolution and I thought to be a harrowing experience which perfectly introduced the reader in the oppressive atmosphere of the time. I do not want to say too much of the plot because I believe it is better for each of you to explore it. I went in almost blindly and I appreciated the opportunity to discover by myself how the plot develops. What I can tell is that you will read an amazing blend of Chinese history, mythology, hard SCi-Fi and well crayoned characters. If I were to reveal anything I guess this quote from the first part of the novel is pretty suggestive.

“It was impossible to expect a moral awakening from humankind itself, just like it was impossible to expect humans to lift off the earth by pulling up on their own hair. To achieve moral awakening required a force outside the human race.”

The novel can be hard on science sometimes but the aspect did not lower my enjoyment, although I was overwhelmed by some explanations as my background is mostly economics. Despite some long science passages, the narration flows beautifully and I was not bored for one second.

I am looking forward to reading the next volume in the series and I hope it will not suffer from the 2nd books syndrome.

"This is when using a few ""Expectations vs. Reality"" memes could have come in handy, actually. Because I remember that this book made quite a splash in the SFF world (netted a Hugo, actually) and the reviews from my very respected GR friends are overwhelmingly glowing.

So maybe I just read it wrong, whatever that means. But…



The story set-up was actually interesting, and there were some ideas that were worth exploring: the startling naivete of believers in a bright shiny idea, and the dangers of one person making decisions that affect the whole humanity, as well as implications of science breakdown. But it is the damn execution that ruined it for me.

Not only do things mostly- *just happen* to our main POV person (like those old 19th century novels where the protagonist serves just as our eyes into the story with not much agency and mostly observational powers) but there's a strange lack of emphasis on events and revelations that by all means should elicit any sort of strong response. It seems that the same amount of emotion is spent on a video game as there is on murders and possibility of alien invasion.

And the wooden, stilted, dry and choppy writing does not help.



Things are basically just chugging along from A to B to C with no drive behind it. At one point I said to my buddy reader that . And characters’ conclusions and motivations make ZERO logical sense to me besides that the plot needs them to think a certain way.

It's a detached monotony with an odd mechanistic cadence to it, and at times I was wondering why I am supposed to care when even the characters don't.



And then, close to the end, we get a sudden boatload of exposition with extra exposition on top, and my eyes rolled so hard I think I strained a muscle. It was almost as bad as a moustache-twirling villain explaining the plot at the end trope.

And in the end I realized I just didn’t care, and although this book is nothing but a prologue into a larger story, it seems, I really don’t care enough even to read the entire trilogy synopsis on Wikipedia.

At least the science bits were almost cool, although exceedingly dry.

"3.5/5 Stars

The Three-Body Problem may be one of the most critically acclaimed Sci-Fi novels of our modern age, and in my opinion, it truly deserved the recognition for all the Sci-Fi ideas and narrative, but not for the characterization.

The Three-Body Problem, the first book in trilogy by Cixin Liu, was actually something I never heard of despite its apparent popularity until I stumbled upon an interview with Barack Obama. He stated that this is one of his favorite novels, Mark Zuckerberg agreed and said the same thing, and that made me decided to give it a try. Plus, the cover for this trilogy is gorgeous. Most of you probably already know that TTBP won Hugo Award for best novel in the year 2015, it also has been nominated for many other Sci-Fi awards and there’s an upcoming movie in production already.







The question is: does it deserved all the praise it received? Mostly yes, especially when it comes to how the book discussed a lot of relatable topics with our current societies; mostly science (d’oh), religions and human nature.



As far as we know, humans have been reaching for extraterrestrial contact forever now; there’s been plenty of “sightings” or conspiracy theories but none of them are concrete proof. I’m a believer that there are another life forms outside of Earth, and there’s no doubt it will be a groundbreaking discovery when they truly make that first contact with our world. As exciting as that sounds, humans tend to forget that when they do appear, how EXACTLY will humanity react? The Three-Body Problem revolved mostly around this question and the concept of The Three-Body Problem equation—that hasn’t been solved—were used to explore motivation and behavior of humans in the face of the unknown.



The book shone light upon many historical events of China’s Cultural Revolution and several philosophies of the well-known scientists such as Einstein. The entire plot was told in two different timelines, Cultural Revolution and our modern age, both in China; the scope of the story, however, is massive. There’s a lot of limitation to what I can talk about here because the main strength of this book lies within its mystery; telling you more of the plot will definitely change your expectation, in fact, I probably already said more than enough.

One thing you should definitely know though is that this is a hard Sci-Fi, and I will not claim to understand all the scientific terms in this book. I’m not a genius or science freak here, some scientific terms did go over my head. Don’t get me wrong, I’m quite good at envisioning and understanding Sci-Fi in my head, but only when it comes to something that has to do with pewpewpew (laser gun), ngungggggggg (lightsaber), boom boom wooshhh (space opera) or alternate reality stuff; the terms that go over my head mostly have to do with physics and scientific calculations. For someone who on a good day got 7/100 (don’t you dare laugh at me) on their physics final exam back in high school, stating that I understood all the scientific terms here is equivalent to saying an iguana invented iPhone; impossible.

Now, enough talking about how dumb and dumber I am with physics, my point is, despite some terms I failed to understand, I was never bored throughout my time reading this book. I don’t think it’s fair for me to judge the prose, especially knowing that this is a translated work but in my opinion, Ken Liu did an excellent job on the translation. Cixin/Ken Liu explained the required terms in understanding the plot as easy as possible, making sure that the readers fully understand the plot at least. The reason I say this book is slightly overrated is not due to the plot or scientific terms; how can I possibly judge something as overrated from something that I don’t fully understand? That’s nonsense. However, it's because of the weak characterizations.

This book is written in third person limited omniscient narrative and this direction is apt for the story that Cixin Liu tried to tell; with a lot of changes in locations and timelines combined with the withholding of information, they provided a sense of mystery that compelled the reader to continue. However, the downside of this is that the characters felt flat and devoid of feelings because we never truly get inside the person’s head. Characterizations are the most important factors in the books I read, and this book suffers from great characters to love. In fact, I'm fully disconnected from the characters that I can’t even bring myself to care whether they die or not.

If you’re a fan of heavy scientific terms, this is truly a book you must try to read. I can’t wait to see what the sequel has in store because the ending of this book made me realize that this is just a beginning to an epic Sci-Fi tale.

"One night, Ye was working the night shift. This was the loneliest time. In the deep silence of midnight, the universe revealed itself to its listeners as a vast desolation.


I have friends who thought this was one of the deepest cleverest books they’ve ever read, and other friends who thought it was an overlong, dull stream of exposition.

The difficulty I have is that I think they’re both kinda right.

Some people said the beginning was slow, but this was the part I found most gripping. I was fascinated by all the parts about the Chinese Cultural Revolution and I thought it was very tense when Wang began seeing an inexplicable countdown in the photographs he took. What happens when the timer gets to zero? I was desperate to know.

I also love books that are like looking up into the vast expanse of space and feeling just how infinitesimal you are. It can be literal or metaphorical, but I think some of the best sci-fi concepts are ones that make me feel tiny. also does it effectively for me, though his books are a lot lighter than Liu's. That feeling of being stood at the centre of something way bigger and more complex than you will ever understand is so powerful (look at me being deep!)

The story unfolds slowly, creating a sense of foreboding and just... wrongness. It was effective. There were moments in the first third or so where I felt deeply unsettled, almost scared.

The hardest part for me was in the middle. There was a lot of technical language that I had to struggle through with the help of google. I am one of those people who will profess an interest in science but, truthfully, I am most acquainted with simply-explained easily digestible science. I gotta be honest.. start talking about nanoparticles and molecular construction and my eyes typically glaze over. But I don’t mind doing the work. Google was my friend. I tried my best to follow it.

I think, though, worse than the technical language and never-ending exposition, was playing the game. In the middle of this book, the characters spend a lot of time playing a video game called . I get that it serves a bigger purpose than simple game-playing, but also it is in fact just a game, and I found it mind-numbing to sit through Wang's adventures into each new Trisolaris civilization.

I've never been into books about playing games, never got the thing. I like playing games myself, but don't understand the appeal of watching others do it. And that's what it felt like I was doing for a big chunk of this book.

Add to this the fact that characterization suffers in favour of exploring the sci-fi concept, and my interest peaked somewhere in the first half.

My husband just finished the second book and liked it more than this one, so I will give it a go. I'm hoping for a little less conversation, a little more action and a lot more in the way of characters I can become invested in. Here's hoping!

"[UPDATED FOR NETFLIX SERIES]
A fascinating piece of sci-fi by Chinese writer Cixin Liu. A surprising mix of nanoscience, string theory, astrophysics. and religion with the Cultural Revolution as a background, the story takes its protagonist Xiao Wang (the nanoscientist) into an adventure that will impact all of humanity. I liked Ye, the astrophysicist, and found Du Shi, the policeman, funny and well-drawn. As for the action and plot, it is easy to read although I got a little lost in the pure science aspects once or twice (despite being an engineer and having dabbled in quantum mechanics years ago). I am excited about reading the next two books (which I suspect will be a little like the Foundation Trilogy by Asimov) and hope you'll also enjoy this one. Note that it won the Hugo Award in 2015, kind of a geek's Pulitzer if you will.

Having finished the entire series, I have to say that it does get better and better as it evolves. The narrative structure of this first book is quite different than the other two but all are extraordinary.
I am reading the Cixin Liu-approved fan extension, by Baoshu now, and it is really good but you have to have finished the trilogy to follow it.


I just finished the Netflix adaptation of this first book. I watched the first episode via Rakuten of the Chinese version, but found the pace to be too repetitive and brooding for my western taste. The American/British version has been scorned by China due to the depiction of the brutality of the Cultural Revolution in the beginning (an illegitimate criticism being that the book itself was unsparing in its depiction of the violence and absurdity of this sorrowful period of Chinese 20th C history, if you are unfamiliar with it, please read up a bit perhaps stating with the beautiful by Dai Sijie). However, their criticism of the nearly all-white casting seems legitimate to me. Where in the book, the protagonists are only connected by the events moving forward in the story and were primarily of Chinese origin, the showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss (creators of the adaptation which started out fantastic and ended abruptly and catastrophically) cast is very white and most of the protagonists start the stories as a group of university friends from Oxford. So, the adaptation already has a very western perspective which the book absolutely did not have. On the other hand, the way that the computer game that Sophon orchestrates is very well-done (even if Sophon looks more Thaï-American than Chinese once again). I suppose that Benioff and Weiss couldn't resist recasting John Bradley here, but I kept seeing Samwell Tarly rather than Jack Rooney and
. The character Evans was rather weak in my opinion as was Auggie (despite being drop-dead gorgeous which is probably why they cast her in it).

If you look at it independently from the original book, it is good sci-fi with a palpant tension in the plot and a narrative that relentlessly pulls you forward towards the final crisis (which will have to wait for the next seasons to occur). The filming and special effects are what you'd expect from the old GoT crew. Let's hope they don't f*ck it up in the later seasons (because honestly seasons 7 and especially 8 were sad parodies of the rest of the show in my opinion). But, if you try to compare it too closely to the book, you will be disappointed I think.

Fino's Cixin Liu and other Chinese SciFi and Fantasy Reviews

"My complete review is published at Grimdark Magazine.

Against the backdrop of the Cultural Revolution, Ye Wenjie’s father is a well-accomplished physics professor at the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing. His embrace of Western science—including the work of Einstein and Bohr—leads him to be accused of embracing reactionary ideologies. He is beaten to death by students from the Red Guard in front of his terrified daughter. Ye Wenjie herself later becomes persecuted and imprisoned for embracing Western thought. She is saved by two military scientists working at the Red Coast, a top-secret space program by the Chinese government, who recognize Ye Wenjie’s outstanding abilities as a physicist.

The core idea of draws directly from Stanisław Lem’s 1961 sci-fi classic, , which considers whether a planet that orbits two suns can support the evolution of life. In , the two suns have vastly different intensities, causing the climate of the orbiting planet, Solaris, to vary drastically depending upon which of the two suns is currently closer. The resulting climatic fluctuations cast doubt upon whether Solaris has a climate consistent enough to support biological evolution, which requires relative climatic stability over millions of years.

In , Cixin Liu ups the ante by introducing a third sun to the problem. The orbital path of a planet around three suns poses a complex mathematical problem that has eluded solution for hundreds of years. In , the orbiting planet, Trisolaris, experiences periods of relative stability punctuated by periods of sudden climatic chaos.

Throughout its planetary history, Trisolaris has undergone hundreds of stable periods, where society has achieved varying levels of scientific and technological development, only to be wiped out by sudden climate changes. The Trisolarans have evolved the ability to dehydrate themselves to survive through these periods of chaos, but they have finally determined that the only way their society can survive in the long-term is to colonize another inhabitable planet with a more stable climate. Compared to Trisolaris, the pale blue dot we know as Earth looks rather enticing.

Beyond its excellent treatment of scientific principles, The Three-Body Problem raises several important philosophical questions, the deepest of these being: Is humanity worth saving? As Ye Wenjie becomes one of the leading scientists searching for extraterrestrial life, her experiences during the Cultural Revolution have molded her views on the value of humanity.

"Remembrance of Earth's Past #1: This book won the 2015 Hugo Award for Fiction despite being originally published in Chinese/Mandarin(?) in 2006! How good does a book have to be to sweep all before it at the Hugo's nearly a decade after being first published? Well. It would have to be a book as good as this one! Nanotech engineer Wang Miao is more or less compelled to infiltrate what appears to be a secret cabal of scientists, compelled by a secret military(!) alliance between NATO, the USA and China! While undercover Wang gets absorbed with the online-immersive game 'The Three Body Problem' a game that seeks to build civilisation in a chaotic world with three suns! It begins to dawn on Wang and his betters, that this game might be much much more than it seems!

A book that starts with one of the key character's Cultural Revolution trauma leading to them being exiled to a scientific research base, a base set up to reach out to possible intelligent life in the universe, was in itself astounding, interesting and uber page turning, until I realised that that was the backstory and just the opening salvo of what I feel beyond doubt will be the greatest speculative fiction / science fiction series I've read since Dan Simmons' . This book takes a frank and honest look at the traumatic impact of the Chinese Cultural Revolution on the science community; what could happen to 'real police' forced to serve under authoritarian regimes; how science would most likely reach out to the stars; how the modern world breeds apathy; and most of all beautifully using real and theoretical physics to illustrate questioning the rationale that far advanced extraterrestrial intelligent life would necessarily be any more enlightened than humankind!

It was after reading , and knowing Yun is as wary as I, to award Five Stars and super-praise a read, that I knew that this book had to be something special, and it so was! What I can only really say is just read it. Page for page the most innovative, awe inspiring, far reaching, outrageous take on hard science/speculative fiction I've ever read, a book that dares to bring science itself to the front of storytelling and making it the biggest 'character' in the story, and somehow doing it so well! One. God. Damn. Fine. Read. 10 out of 12, Five Star Read.

"While this is obviously a masterpiece of hard sci-fi, that is also the reason I had a hard time connecting to it. While the science behind it all is complex and interesting, I found myself glazing over many a time and detaching from the story. The characters didn't feel real to me. Aside from that, this is a book I'd love to discuss with others because I wonder how much of this book was harder for me due to cultural and historical differences I wasn't even aware of while reading.

I think I have discovered that hard sci-fi is not for me, as I need more of a connection to the story and characters, but I'd recommend this for any science buff.

"I just spent a week with this hard science fiction, Hugo-award winning novel from Chinese author Cixin Liu and I have to admit: I'm impressed.

The Three-Body Problem had me putting off tasks to pick it up, stuck with me throughout my day, and was always a pleasure to read when I sat down with it. With that said, this isn’t a novel I’d easily recommend to everyone. This isn’t a review that offers a pan-recommendation along with its 5-star rating. Indeed, this review seeks to help an intrigued reader decide if this book would be a good fit for them and their reading taste.



The premise of is that an alien civilization receives a message from a Chinese scientist in the 1970s and plans to come to Earth, naturally, for a good old-fashioned invasion.

I know, I know. You’ve read this story before, right?

I assure you that this is a wholly original take wherein the aliens don’t even make a proper appearance for the entire novel. Instead, is more concerned with its titular problem, scientific history, cutting edge scientific theory, and a fair smattering of ludicrous science near the novel’s end. This novel revels in its appreciation of science and a bit of brushing up on introductory physics would not go amiss.

However, if you don’t recall the mathematical expression that governs the motion of two celestial bodies in a vacuum, you need not worry. Cixin Liu (and his translator, Ken Liu) does a fantastic job in explaining basic and high-level science concepts in clear language. Although there were times in which I had to set the book down to interpret, these moments were largely towards the end of the book where the science gets really out there.

I was also less than impressed with the video game within the book that serves as an introduction to the alien civilization. Roughly, each time the game is booted up the player is greeted by an ever-advancing Earth-based representation of scientific progress. So, at first you meet an ancient Chinese king, but eventually you hang out with Einstein. This grew on me after the first few chapters set in the game. Liu uses these sections to convey the difficulty of the scientific problem at hand, show reverence for science history, and introduce the civilization in an innocuous way.



One of the things that really sets this reading experience apart from traditional science fiction is that it is really, really Chinese. The first 100 pages deal mostly with the Chinese Cultural Revolution. In fact, after 100 pages I realized that I was enjoying that material so much that I wouldn’t have minded if aliens never stopped in. Of course, as the novel goes on it does an excellent job of weaving together the threads from the Cultural Revolution and the impending invasion.

This Chinese-based sci-fi is a breath of fresh air, and it’s a shame that China’s most popular sci-fi author has never made the jump to English before. Not only is it set in a different part of the world from most sci-fi you’ll encounter, but it also feels remarkably different in writing style and plot development. Where other novels skim over the nitty-gritty of the science behind spectacle, spends pages making sure the reader knows what to expect. This never feels obnoxious; on the contrary, it is refreshing to see an author convey a concept in such understandable language.

Though the novel alternates between the time of discovery during the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the present day story, it never feels random. There are stretches where I spent 50 pages in the present, took a brief 10 page detour into the past, only to return for a lengthy bit set in the present. The story unfolds rather than following a strictly predictable path. Instead of predictability, it seems guided by logic. You don’t know about Y, but once you know X, Y follows much more easily.

This all makes for a read that is compelling because it makes the reader feel as if they are hot on the pursuit of the central mystery.



You’ve probably noticed that I haven’t mentioned the cast of characters, and there’s good reason. I’m not the first reader to note this, but the lead characters in are pretty flat. Indeed, Wang Miao may be a brilliant nanotechnology researcher, but I’d be hard pressed to tell you much about his personality. Instead of driving the plot, Wang reacts to it. I never felt that the decisions he makes in the novel were guided by his belief system. He’s kind of like the cart on an on-rail amusement park ride. The ride sure is thrilling, but you’re unlikely to remember much about the cart.

Now, normally I’d be roasting this book alive for having such weak characterization. I mean, why read a book if you don’t care about the characters? genuinely makes the case for having a fairly empty lead. I kept thinking during my read that I could imagine being in Wang’s shoes, pulling back the curtain on yet another mystery. It is genuinely impressive that Liu is able to pull off, at least for me, the sensation of feeling like you’re in on the mystery that would be lost with a stronger character.



This novel doesn’t end with resolution, though you could conceivably just read this novel and come away with a complete story. Of course, there are two more novels in the series that will delve further into the impressive, exciting, and pessimistic world that Liu has created. I’m hoping for some better-developed characters, but will happily continue on if the subsequent books are as mentally stimulating as this.

"I liked this and there is no doubt that this is a science heavy, brilliantly produced and contemplated, highly original SF novel from a physics understanding Chinese author that was good enough to win a slew of awards including the Hugo.

But I like to watch Ridiculousness. I like Travis McGee. I like Mickey F****** Spillane. Beer and pizza and a bug zapper is quality entertainment.

“Conan – what is best in life?”

Three Body Problem did not have near enough axe welding barbarians or laser beams for my taste.

Liu Cixin’s wildly popular, speculative fiction gem was first published in China in 2008 as 三体 (I guess – that’s what it says on Goodreads) and I enjoyed the English translation written by Ken Liu (himself a very talented writer) published in 2014.

Liu begins in the late 60s during the Chinese Cultural Revolution and then moves forward in time to a near future where a strange virtual reality game replicates an even stranger reality.

And the aliens.

Maybe I would have liked this more if I were a physicist. A very smart commentator opined that perhaps Westerners don’t get the subtle nuances of a writer whose cultural background is not based upon the individual but rather is more attuned to a gestalt perspective.

Като верен почитател на жанра, формирал част от личните ми книжни предпочитания в края на осемдесетте и през деветдесетте години на миналия век, давам на ""Трите тела"" от Лиу Цъсин много висока оценка - и историята, и героите са чудесно развити и така успяха да задържат интереса ми до края на тази първа част от трилогията. Признавам, не разбрах всичко от физиката в книгата, но схванах общите идеи на автора и това само засили удоволствието ми.

Лиу Цъсин е вплел в интригата на този роман много интересни проблеми, върху които си струва човек да си поблъска главата. Очаквам развитието на клопките заложени пред човешката цивилизация от събитията през ""Трите тела"" в следващите два романа да е отново майсторски изпипано!

Интересно би било и да се научи, как се е промъкнала тази книга покрай жестоката комунистическа цензура, властваща в червен Китай и в този момент.

"The Three-Body Problem is part one of an award-winning trilogy by Liu Cixin — and is arguably the best Chinese science fiction novel ever translated into English. Liu uses the “three-body problem” of classical mechanics to ask some terrifying questions about human nature and what lies at the core of civilization.

The series explores the world of the Trisolarans, a race that is forced to adapt to life in a triple star system, on a planet whose gravity, heat, and orbit are in constant flux. Facing extinction, the Trisolarans plan to evacuate and conquer the nearest habitable planet, and finally chooses a candidate/victim when it intercepts a message—from Earth. The Three-Body Problem has been translated into English by award-winning writer, Ken Liu (author of books such as The Grace of Kings). Take a look at Stephan Martiniere's way-cool cover for the coming Tor Books edition!)

Special note… The Three Body Problem deals very closely with the issue of SETI and the Fermi Paradox and whether we should shout ""yoo-hoo!"" into the cosmos -- a quandary about which I've also written, from time to time.
￼

But the biggest news is this proof of the maturation of Chinese science fiction into the top ranks of thorough and fascinating thought experimentation. I’ve long maintained that the health of an enlightened and progressive society is measured by how vibrant is its science fiction, since that is where true self-critique and appraisal and hope lie. If so, the good news stretches beyond China!

"2.5 stars

There has been an enormous amount of buzz and accolades surrounding Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem. It has been nominated for numerous awards, including a 2015 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Does it deserve all the hype? In some respects I can see why it has garnered so much praise. The science is fun, there are some interesting philosophical concepts, and the world-building is also interesting. However, that for me is where the praise ends. Where the book fails is in the basic fundamentals of what makes a good story: writing, characterization, pacing, and plot. Harsh, I know.

The characters are flat, the writing is lifeless and choppy, the pacing is slow as molasses in some places, and some of the dialogue is downright terrible. There are instances where the author awkwardly uses dialogue to info dump:





There are also weird instances where characters behave like stage actors, having side conversations with one another in order to provide the audience with info while other characters in the scene pretend not to listen. Strange and awkward.

Despite these problems, the story does start out interesting enough with the character of Ye Wenjie during the Chinese Revolution. However, it later jumps to the modern day, through the point of view character of Wang Miao, where its problems can no longer be ignored and the story fizzles.

Perhaps it is unfair of me to heap such harsh criticism at the writing since this is a translation from the original Chinese. Maybe these issues do not appear in the original? I cannot be sure, and if someone has read the original I'd love to hear your thoughts. But, as it stands I can only go with the version I've read. Sorry, book. You had some interesting elements, but not enough to overlook the problems.

"3.5 stars, rounded up purely for the entertainment value.

First, I should probably clarify that this is a review for 三体, the Chinese original of The Three-Body Problem, and therefore contains no opinion on Ken Liu's translation (except that I'm happy he fixed a factual error in the original text, which I found out while discussing with friends in ). I should probably also clarify that, had this book been in English, I would've probably DNF'ed or given it a much lower rating, since the writing style hits quite a few no-nos that are typically immediate turnoffs for me -- bland and distant narrative voice, all tell and no show, flat stick figure characters, weird and awkward moments when sudden emotional monologues pop up that build up from nowhere, etc ... But somehow, either because I have a different cultural expectation here (many of these traits aren't too uncommon for Chinese books as far as I can tell), or because I can read Chinese much faster and skim over the details I don't like (it took me only about a third of the time I typically need for an English book to finish this one), I was able to look past these problems and focus on just the ideas instead of the writing, which honestly is what I think the author expects us to do.

Okay, with those caveats out of the way, I can now talk about the science fiction part.

The majority of the book felt like a collection of trivia facts to me, in a good way. Things started slow, and it took seven chapters to get to the real focus of the plot, but once it got there I was thoroughly intrigued. The video game chapters, which explained the three body problem through a semi-historic tour of philosophy, math, and basic computer technology, were entertaining and surprisingly accurate (or, at least as accurate as I could tell. I did find certain details misleading, such as the error linked at the beginning of this review and the fact that (mild spoiler)
, but none of the important information was off, and the messages behind the examples were all valid). The backstory of Red Coast, a space radio station, got increasingly interesting over time as well, and I was thrilled to have learned quite a few random facts about cosmic radiation and directed-energy weapons. It's been a while since something prompted so much googling to satisfy my curiosity, and for that alone I thought the book was worth reading.

And then ... there came the ending with the big reveal and twist that made me wonder if the author was tripping.

Here I have a confession to make: I am not a physicist, so I had a lot of fun reading that chapter and cackling at the insanity of it. BUT, even a non-physicist me knows that a lot of the science behind this is pure fiction:
So if the credulity of science bothers you on an intellectual level, or if you don't like your hard sci-fi turning into a fantasy... then tread carefully. But otherwise, I thought it was nice to just see how far the author's imagination could take us, which, I admit, was quite far.

At this point though, I'm not entirely sure if I want to read The Dark Forest, since it appears to take a more typical first-contact turn and feels quite a bit different from this book. But I'll consider it, and I might even finally pick up A Brief History of Time after being intrigued by all the cosmic trivia facts.

P.S. For anyone else who might find this useful, I stumbled upon written by a physicist, which talked about some other science bugs in this book that I had absolutely no idea were there. I liked part 1 of the post more than part 2, though they were both massively informative.

P.P.S. This was , who unfortunately didn't enjoy it as much, but it was a lot of fun and quite educational nevertheless! Thanks a bunch <3

"1 star is a little harsh, but this is (imo) a very bad book. I'd recommend reading some of the 1 and 2-star reviews here before you give it a try. Yes, I'm aware that (at time of writing) 125,840 raters and 13,226 reviewers, liked it (on average) a whole lot more than I did.

I read maybe 40% before putting it aside. Cardboard characters, a plot line that is purely arbitrary and nonsensical.... Bah. Some of the Chinese details are of interest. Say 1.5 stars to where I gave up. I've read (and liked) a short story by Liu Cixin at Tor.com, fwtw.

"Alright. I read this wrong. It's all on me.
I've got my Cone of Shame and am headed to the Shame Corner right now.
It was nice being out for awhile but we all knew I couldn't stay out for long.

I'm not sure if something was lost in translation, if I'm just really not good at science, or if I am waaaaay too American, but whatever the case, I did not enjoy this.

Well, I , but only through maybe the first half. Then it got tedious, then it got boring, then it got downright ridiculous, and then I stabbed my ears out so I wouldn't have to listen anymore.

The story follows two timelines and characters that you know are going to intersect.
It starts with (phonetically-spelled, based on the reader's terrible pronunciation): Astrophysicist Yeah Wen-Sia who sees her father killed by three fanatic teenage girls when he won't deny science during the Cultural Revolution. Then, her favorite and best teacher commits suicide, her mother, who is terribly unstable, abandons her, and her sister has joined the Revolution and is a fanatic in her own right. Ye is angry and carries this anger with her to the woods where she is employed in deforestation at the base of Red Coast Station which is, essentially, a military base with a huge satellite that sits up on top of a hill and is fairly inaccessible and anyone who even strolls near will be shot.

The second storyline is that of (phonetically-spelled, based on the reader's terrible pronunciation) Wong Meow, owner of zero personality. He's a nanotech/biology somesuch researcher scientist in the current day who is alarmed when the nation's top physicists and other brainy sorts start committing suicide. I don't really remember, if I ever actually knew, how he falls into all of this, but he gets involved, via a tough-as-nails cop named Dah Shee, with a sort of investigation into the larger scope of the problem that is causing these scientists to kill themselves.
Through a series of not-noticeable events, Wang finds out about an online game called Three Body and he decides to play. It's a weird game that follows civilizations as they grow and then collapse on a world where there are three suns and these suns pose a real-life (like, real to our lives) mathematical quandary called the Three Body Problem in which three things whiz around a stationary object (I think. I may be making the stationary object up) but each has a different kind of orbit and they're sort of random and you must find the pattern of their zoomings to predict when they'll be close to each other or the object and when they'll be farthest apart, etc. How can you track the movement of these three bodies to predict what they'll do next, is the question. At any rate, if you solve the Three Body Problem in the game, you win. Only really smart people can play this game, obviously. People whose brains think in spatial relationships and numbers at all hours of the day, I assume.

There are more characters but these are the main two and their lives intersect and things happen.

Before I spew forth my list of what I misunderstood, I'm going to share what I thought I was going to read.

Ok, so, it's obvious this went WAY over my head. Way way way over. I'm probably too inculturated in Western SciFi to be able to appreciate what I listened to. And, by the way, what I listened to was crap because, yet again, the narrator is some white dude who doesn't speak Chinese. Also, he made the Chinese tough-as-nails cop's voice alternate between a NYC beat cop accent and a Texan accent. It was bizarre. I did not enjoy that at all.

I've read several of the other five-star reviews here and I've yet to find any enlightenment on my misunderstandings. I'm just seeing a lot of people going nuts over how amazing this is and I can't understand, even from their glowing reviews, what they read that I didn't.

This is the first in a trilogy. I feel like I should listen to them all just to find out if any of my questions are answered but I'm not really into self-torture so probably, I'll pass.

"I have a rule that I have held to fairly robustly for many years that you should always finish the book you start. You owe it to yourself and to the writer. If we were to give up every book that didn’t manage to hold our interest, we’d run the risk of giving up on whole swathes of modern literature. We’d also stray dangerously close to the dimwit view that characters need to be ‘likable’, things need to be thrilling and stuff needs to be happening.

I have held on until the end of some truly fucking shit novels. Two of them were by Nicola Barker – currently the most execrable living novelist in English. It’s hardly a secret that Barker has in her possession time-stamped photographs of the UK’s premier literary editors doing unspeakable sexual acts, and makes very efficient use of them.

I’ve only abandoned two books in the past five years. One of them was Nabokov’s fucking awful ‘Pale Fire’ – a disjointed, unreadable pile of shite chiefly composed of footnotes around a parody text. Think of it as a literary in-joke that would have worked if only it had been 300 pages shorter, perhaps in the Christmas edition of a literary journal. As a fundraiser. No more then two pages. It enraged me, but at least it was Nabokov. I still contrived to finish though - by literally using a form of speed-reading meets scanning that allowed me to claim to have seen all the words. ‘I counted them out and I counted them in’.

The other was a piss-poor piece of whimsy by a dad-joker who occasionally writes for Guardian called Ian Sansom, which I was given as a proof copy by someone I knew who worked for his publisher. This was an achingly unfunny, cliche-stuffed pile of whimsy called ‘The Case of the Missing Books’. Its protagonist was a Northern Irish Jew called Israel…I can’t remember. Something like Flaherty or Armstrong. It was so infuriatingly shit – imagine a sitcom that only got one series in the late eighties, perhaps starring Hale and Pace – that I left it the overhead locker of a plane after writing ‘This book is irredeemably shit. Do not read it’ in the inside cover in biro.

And so to the ‘Three Body Problem’. It’s long and it’s tedious. There is no character. I read plenty of SF and I bet I will be told that this is ‘Hard SF’, that’s all. It’s not ‘Hard SF’ – it’s ‘Fucking Boring SF’.

There is no character development. I could not distinguish one protagonist from another. I didn’t even know their gender most of the time. I admit, I was afflicted by the same laziness that afflicts bored readers of Russia literature; Vronskii quickly sounds like Vranitskii and Radionov sounds like Radishchev. And so here: Yi and Wan and Wiao and Who? Neither could I distinguish between Red Force and Red Base, or whatever that was.

I didn’t care about the computer game either. Whole paragraphs and pages were dedicated to tedious textbook science – perhaps terrifically exciting if your thing is telescopes sans human interest. Paragraphs like “Yi had thought that the electro magnetic pulses were negatively charged by a reverse diode, but the Association of Federal Science revealed that a latitudinal pulse had in fact elevated the nano-trousers to a force of not three but ten gradients. This could only mean that the Foundation’s position on Dr Wienerschnitzl’s theorem – which Yang had mentioned in her studies – was correct. If this was true, the conclusion could only be that Mike Evans was wrong’. (Note: the most entertaining bit in the 58% of the book I read was the sudden appearance of a bloke called ‘Mike Evans’. Mike Evans is the name you’d give to the embattled caretaker manager at Wrexham when the veteran manager leaves after four consecutive defeats in September. Frankly, the novel would have been vastly improved if it had featured the character of an embattled caretaker manager at Wrexham.

Look, I’m pretty sure I’ve read most of the Hugo winners of recent years. Perhaps this picks up in the final third. Perhaps the aliens show up and they’re very interesting or massive sadists. Look at Michael Faber though: you can do interstellar and nothing happens and still get a very decent novel. This? A quarter of the way in, to be dehydrated, packed into a barn and eaten by rats felt like a small mercy.

"In an afterword, Liu expresses his opinion that science fiction should not be used to make social commentary but should instead restrict itself to playing with ideas of science and technology. I was surprised to see that because Three Body had struck me (tentatively, since I know little about China) as an especially novel, with much to say about how societies should be organised. The portrait of an ‘authoritarian’ alien civilisation, where individuality is repressed in favour of homogenous common benefit, seemed almost too obvious a comment on Communism, especially when juxtaposed, as it is here, with historical scenes of the Cultural Revolution.

Whether you accept his protestations or not is unlikely to affect your enjoyment of the novel, which blends historical tragedy with the kind of slow-burning first contact story that harks back to the golden age of the 1940s and '50s in the US. Perhaps the most fascinating scenes in the book, and certainly the eeriest, are those set within a virtual-reality computer game which is concerned with the practical implications of the in physics; these chapters seem grand and bleak and impressively inhuman in scope.

Less successful, perhaps, are the interpersonal relationships and the motivations of the characters in general. The plot hinges on the assumption that, faced with a particular challenge to their scientific and existential ideas, vast numbers of people would deliberately opt for suicide, both personally and in terms of trying to destroy their entire species. This seemed a little infeasible to me, though perhaps it's just a more Chinese way of looking at things. Either way, it makes for a curious and unusual plot. (An interesting companion read might be Adam Roberts's , which used first contact as a way of writing about Stalin's Russia.)

The translation, from (the unrelated) Ken Liu, is excellent on a sentence-by-sentence level, though apparently he rearranged some of the chapters for an English-speaking audience, which I can't say I approve of.

"This Hugo Award winning SF novel by Chinese author Liu Cixin is delightfully intelligent and complex, and I really appreciated the authentic Chinese characters in the story and the insights into China's history and culture. The novel is also a little slow and dry in parts, with a certain formality that (I would guess) echoes the original Chinese writing style. I also had some trouble keeping all of the characters straight in my head; most of the characters have Chinese names, and the names tended to blend together in my brain, partly due to my lack of familiarity with that language and partly because characterization isn’t really one of the strengths of this book.

It begins in the 1960s, during the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath. A respected professor is beaten to death by three young women who are Red Guards, and his astrophysicist daughter, Ye Wenjie, is eventually shipped off to a remote mountaintop where a government-sponsored group is secretly exploring the possibility of electronic communication with aliens. Eventually it actually works - but there's a clear possibility of danger to all of humanity. Ye Wenjie makes a fateful decision. We then jump forward some 40+ years, where the story picks up again with the fallout from that decision, though we're favored with a few more flashbacks to the sixties.

This novel is not going to be every reader's cuppa tea, but I think readers who like intricately plotted hard (VERY hard) SF novels should definitely give this series a try. I flailed and almost gave up when I hit some chapters that involve lengthy, detailed descriptions of a video game, a very odd role-playing game on an alien world (yet with human characters). But I powered through, and once all the pieces started fitting together, it got fascinating. I'm up for book #2!

"Loving the Netflix adaptation 🎥, maybe this is story is even better suited for the screen than the rendition in a book 📚
Addictive, gripping, filmic in scenes, big on ideas, but sloppy in execution and characterisation - 3.5 stars rounded down
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. - The queen from



starts with the ruthlessness of the cultural revolution, and I immediately felt I knew so little of this period, which intrigued me. These scenes, set in such a chaotic era, form the characters and much of the story of the book:


The speeches in part 1 about the relativity theory did feel a bit bizarre since it is a rather French Terror style setting they are placed in, and I found the writing sometimes a bit too obviously aiming for drama and emotional impact, but then at a breakneck pace. But still I wanted to read on and get at a deeper understanding of the story was weaving. And basically those conflicting feelings applied for me to the whole book.


Breakneck speed of storytelling and strange phenomena continue, culminating in a very strange chapter in a VR world (like a Civilization game on acid and then Chinese in setting).
The concepts are amazing, secret scientific societies, a gulf of freak suicides, a countdown appearing in eyesight.
But the execution lacks finesses. The characters are pushed around and exposed to extreme revelations and circumstances without an apparent need for reflection.
Also characters all are fully up to speed (for instance Da Shi saying: , while he has no way of knowing that the main character of this section discovered the aforementioned VR game), don’t seem to need to sleep and always know someone who knows someone to further their plans of complicated scientific checks in ridiculously short time frames.

The atmosphere in this section is very like in and or at his most imaginative in the series.
In edgy coolness meets weirdness it also made me think of the Matrix movies and finally I had some
vibes with all the Beijing highlights, including the Rem Koolhaas CCTV tower, the glass Beijing Planetarium and sleeping in a car at the Forbidden Palace.

The author focusses on the big tickets and not the development in between needed to get to the conclusion. For instance the VR game, the main character is just propelled in 5 sessions to the best player ever and uncovers so much which apparently no one ever before him did. All characters he meet are instrumental to the plot continuing, I mean his wife is never once mentioned after his first uncanny experiences, nor his regular work. The whole world building feels shaky because of this, not withstanding the gripping quality of some scenes (a living computer for instance) and ideas.



How is everyone taking crazy far reaching decisions based on one or two experiences was something I thought a lot while reading part 3.
There is an vibes speech about the wicked nature of human civilization which was kind of cringeworthy to read.
But again there are beautiful scenes, like a hostage situation with mini nuclear bombs and the most cool application of nano fibers ever in the Panama Canal.
Technology and civilization as a kind of cancer eating up the natural environment was a fascinating, more philosophical concept coming back in this part.
And we finally get the main question from the book into focus: what happens to society when we are confronted with extraterrestrial life and a civilization more advanced than our own?

While reading on and on, addicted, it felt like I read a manga or anime in terms of sweeping statements and ultra high stakes, or a film like Pacific Rim.

And there is such a megacrazy idea, at the edges of scientific understanding, near the end of the book with the Sophons and the way human technological development could be fundamentally impeded. However I can’t imagine how a civilization capable of such dimensional manipulation of matter and all the possibilities it entails would still concern itself with anything mundane as conquest (or just focus their energy on fixing their own homeworld). Also that the light speed is still a barrier feels weird.
The nature of scientific progress (by the way, for a very interesting article in this respect I can warmly recommend: ) is also liberally taken as a plot device, why our development with exponentially increasing technology would be unique is an interesting but unexplained variance.
And finally the humanity and the bug analogy for the relationship is not that hopeful given how insect populations are in sharp decline in the last few decades.


I realize I sound a bit like a sourpuss, but I think this is a reflection of the quality of ideas Liu Cixin takes on. I just wanted the execution of the plot and depth of character to be on par with the extraordinary originality of the ideas. The sweeping view on science and humanity is very good and The Three Body Problem was definitely a engaging and entertaining read. I saw a lot of reviews saying that the is even better than this first part, so I do plan to continue discovering Remembrance of Earth's Past.

This is the first book of a trilogy.

The story begins during the early years of China's 'Cultural Revolution.' Ye Wenjie, a young astrophysicist, sees her father - a physics professor - tortured and murdered by a group of young Red Guards.



Like many educated citizens Ye Wenjie is labeled a 'counter-revolutionary' and sent to cut trees for the Construction Corps before being recruited to work at a secret facility called Red Coast Base.

At first Ye Wenjie has limited access to the base's surreptitious activities but in time her abilities and intelligence give her wide access to the installation. Over time Ye Wenjie makes some startling discoveries and engages in some questionable behavior. (To say more would lead to spoiler territory.)



Some years later, when the Cultural Revolution wanes, Ye Wenjie is allowed to return home and become a university professor.



In current times an applied physicist named Wang Miao - who's developed a very strong nanomaterial - is recruited by a committee composed of military officers/police. They ask Wang to help investigate a rash of physicist suicides.



Wang reluctantly agrees and is assisted by a suspended cop called Da Shi - a disheveled, abrasive, pushy, off-putting guy.

>

As things turn out though, Da Shi's ability to think outside the box is useful and his common sense is comforting....so I developed quite a liking for the fellow.

While Wang Miao is looking into the physicist suicides he develops peculiar/frightening 'vision problems' and starts to play an immersive computer game called ""Three Body.""



The game is set on Trisolaris, a distant planet inhabited by extraterrestrials. Trisolaris has a very unstable environment. During 'chaotic periods' (extremely hot or cold) most Trisolarans are dehydrated, rolled up, and stored in dehydratories. During 'stable periods' (mild weather) the Trisolarans are rehydrated and go about their business. Still, there are frequent 'crashes' when the entire Trisolaran civilization is destroyed and has to start over.



The shifts between chaotic and stable periods on Trisolaris are completely random and abrupt. Thus the player's goal is to discover why they happen and to predict long-term stable periods. Wang determines that the chaos occurs because the planet has three suns....thus the 'three-body problem.' [Note: On the internet the three-body problem is defined as follows: ""the problem of taking an initial set of data that specifies the positions, masses and velocities of three bodies for some particular point in time and then determining the motions of the three bodies, in accordance with Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation.""] In essence it's almost impossible to accurately predict the motion of Trisolaris' three suns.....but Wang Miao thinks he can do it.

As the story continues to unfold it turns out that Ye Wenjie's experiences at Red Coast Base, the physicist suicides, Wang Miao's nanomaterial research, and the three-body game are all connected. And they have something to do with the fact that humans have managed to contact an alien civilization. (Again, more information would be a spoiler.)



The story addresses an interesting topic: how would people react if they knew there were other intelligent beings in the universe? And what would happen if the other beings were on their way here? (I've always thought extraterrestrials - if they found out about Earth - might come here, wipe us out, and move in. But maybe that's just me....LOL)

There's a lot of physics jargon in the book and some fancy shenanigans with protons that stretch suspension of disbelief to the max...even for sci-fi.



In the end, though, I enjoyed the book very much. China provides a great (and unusual) background for a science fiction book and the story is riveting, with interesting characters. Highly recommended to fans of science fiction.

I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.

The story is being adapted for a series on Netflix.

"To effectively contain a civilization’s development and disarm it across such a long span of time, there is only one way: kill its science.
The Three-Body Problem is a very original story, and one that’s rather difficult to describe. Set in the present, in flashbacks against the backdrop of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and at some points in cyberspace, this novel tells a tale of humanity’s first contact with an alien race.

I have read reviews stating that feels Chinese. I can’t say whether the book feels Chinese (though it is set there) or whether it’s just this writer’s style. I can say that this book is hard sci-fi, like a Crichton novel on steroids. There are extensive sections in which various physics or computing concepts are laid out. They all serve the plot well, but this style will not be for everyone. Especially since the main weakness of the book is characterization. There is really only one fully developed character (Ye Wenjie), and one entertaining sidekick (Da Shi). Otherwise, the characters are generally passive and largely forgettable.

is a plot-driven story about big ideas. I love that it is very pro-science: science is the hope for humanity, and stopping earth’s scientific progress is the goal of our enemies. I can see why it won the Hugo Award for best science-fiction novel. I will definitely read the second book in the trilogy. Recommended, and highly recommended if you enjoy hard sci-fi.

"“Is it possible that the relationship between humanity and evil is similar to the relationship between the ocean and an iceberg floating on its surface? Both the ocean and the iceberg are made of the same material. That the iceberg seems separate is only because it is in a different form. In reality, it is but a part of the vast ocean.”



Reading this book was an incredibly enriching experience. Sci-fi is one of my favourite genres, but I have to admit that sometimes books in this category can be a little ""superficial"" and mainly for entertainment purposes. I believe this author reached peaks comparable to Asimov with this work! I couldn't put this book down, and I even read whole sections of it more than once for pure pleasure (and also some because I couldn't understand what he was saying 🤣 I'm not a quantum physicist so yeah 🤣). What a ride! A true work of genius.



As for the three different settings of the book, the contemporary one, the historical one (set during the chinese revolution) and the ""sci-fi"" one (of which I am not going to talk to prevent spoilers), I was intrigued by the first, extremely interested in the second, and absolutely mesmerized by the third. The length of the novel and the ability of the writer created a world so well-built and immersive that I felt catapulted in an other dimension. Until now, only a few sci-fi books have given me a similar experience, and they are all ""classics"". I truly believe this one to be a modern classic already.



Finally, the richness of the purely sci-fi aspect of it, is so imaginative and revolutionary that I am sure I will think about it for years to come. Some sections of it reminded me of pioneer texts like (if you've read both books, I am pretty sure you know of which part I am talking about). I would like to write more, but really I don't want to spoil this experience to anyone! I can only recommend with the greatest enthusiasm to read this book as soon as possible! 🙃



note: I just finished re-reading this book and I can confirm 100% that this is a masterpiece!!! Can't wait to go on with the series.

"This was a baffling and frustrating read. Translator Ken Liu states in a postscript that “The Chinese literary tradition shaped and was shaped by its readers, giving rise to different emphases and preferences in fiction compared to what American readers expect.” No kidding. Apparently these ‘different emphases and preferences’ include the lack of a plot.

Liu Cixin’s novel is so tangentially concerned with any kind of narrative momentum that all the major plot points are introduced with great reluctance and, equally quickly, blatantly ignored. A lot of the characters are mere mouthpieces for lengthy diatribes on science and politics, with said pontificating going on for pages in many instances.

Despite Cixin’s stern emphasis on scientific accuracy (in the light of current knowledge, that is), there is a ludicrous set-piece towards the end, involving the use of ‘nano wire’ as an anti-terrorist weapon, that seems as out of place as a nun in a James Bond movie.

I did enjoy the account of trying to conduct research during the Cultural Revolution in China. But Cixin’s attempt to bolt this template onto an alien invasion story is not in the least convincing.

Neither does Cixin offer any novel approach (ha ha) to the perennial thorn in the genre’s side, namely the danger of anthropomorphising aliens in SF (which makes it akin to colonial fiction in many ways, much to the chagrin of many genre proponents, I think).

Apparently Cixin is a serious literary darling in China’s SF community, which has millions of readers. I think the problem with SF in China is that, developmentally, it is about on par with the 1960s in America. Hopefully this means it will get much, much better.

Of course, this was the novel used to defeat the Sad Puppies at the 2015 Hugo Awards. Unfortunately, I think politics played a much more decisive hand than literary merit.

But I do not want to risk sounding churlish: I am glad I read this, which is a good sign that more international SF is being translated and thereby disseminated in the genre’s traditional Western domain. This can only be good for all concerned.

"“It was impossible to expect a moral awakening from humankind itself, just like it was impossible to expect humans to lift off the earth by pulling up on their own hair. To achieve moral awakening required a force outside the human race.”



The setup and the way Liu Cixin's The Three-Body Problem slowly unfolded through multiple decades takes some time to grab you, but it is really intriguing. This historical context (China's Cultural Revolution) spoke directly to the motivations of Ye Wenjie as she returns a message to aliens (Trisolarans) making long distance contact with Earth. Though it will be centuries before physical contact can be made, her message sets up the factions and conflict that will fill the intervening years. How the Trisolarans react to her message and prepare for contact with Earth is interesting as well. Yet another layer is added when Wang Miao plays a strange and strangely relevant virtual reality game called Three Body. Ambitious and intriguing read! 4.5 stars

"One of my favorite ways of choosing a book by an unfamiliar author to read is by the buzz from sf blogs and discussion forums. Not any old buzz mind you, I don’t want to end up reading “50 Shades” or some equally unreadable blockbusters, I only take notice of the excitement among SF/F reading communities.

was my ’s book of the month (three months ago), it was recommended to me a friend here on GR and I have noticed numerous blogs, articles and online discussions about it so if I am to have any hope of keeping up with the Sci-fi Joneses I’d better give it a shot*. About the official synopsis, I am surprised how much spoiler is in it. I am glad I did not read the synopsis until I was half way through the book, but even then I wish I had finished the book before reading the thing. Having said that, when I tried to write my own synopsis I find myself struggling as the book’s storyline is quite complex with several plot twists and turns.

It starts in China in 1967 during the Cultural Revolution, astrophysicist Ye Wenjie witnesses her father’s public execution at the hands of some young Red Guards women. This is beginning of her disdain for the entire human race and a later betrayal by a friend which leads to her agreeing to join a top secret Government science project which has will have a great impact on the future of humanity. About forty years later Wang Miao a nanomaterial researcher stumbles upon a VR game that seems to have surprising real world consequences.

OK, a little bit of a spoiler now. After all the surprising plot developments this book ultimately turns out to be about
. It is not about that though, there are many facets to this book: Hard SF / cyberpunk / conspiracy / Chinese Cultural Revolution, not to mention the human drama, the political allegory, the philosophy and the moral themes of loyalty and betrayal (of individuals and eventually the entire human race). I think even the kitchen sink is mentioned at one point!

is a huge bestseller in China, it is the first book of a trilogy (only this first volume translated and published internationally so far) and a film adaptation is in the making (by Chinese film makers, not Hollywood – yet). The book reminds me a little bit of Neal Stephenson's though it is much grimmer in tone and also Asimov’s classic (ah, I need to reread this!). Considering the hype I am surprising how divisive this book is, it has all the things most hard SF fans normally want, the plausible science, the cool tech, huge ideas etc. I suspect the dislike among some of the readers is due to the book's initial focus on the Cultural Revolution in the 60s. If you read sci-fi just for the sci-fi and you don't want to know about this part of Chinese history this substantial part of the book may bore you. I know nothing about this history and I personally found it to be very interesting. There are also some lengthy scientific expositions which are a little hard to follow. I quite like how the main characters are developed but none of them are particularly sympathetic, not even Wang Miao who is described as “a good man”. I love the cyberspace world (or metaverse) of this book, it is bizarre and fascinating; how it impacts the real world is more reminiscent of than . It also leads to the explanation of the book’s title which is a brilliant hard sci-fi concept.

The New York Times described this book as . While the comparison makes sense stylistically Liu Cixin is very different from Sir Arthur C. I don’t know how much of this is due to the excellent translation by but there is much more characterization and emotion here than any Clarke books I have read. This does not make him a better author than Clarke though, Clarke was a master storyteller who told some ingenious stories with much more economy and clarity of vision.

So given the divisive opinions of this book I would recommend it with caution that you try a sample chapter first if possible, or at least read a few trusted reviews. Also, the book is not an easy breezy read, there are passages that will tax your brain and others that require your patience. Personally I would love to find out what happen in the subsequent volumes of the trilogy. Get on with it Mr. Ken Liu!

"4.5 stars.

This critically well-acclaimed science fiction novel certainly deserves its laurels.

""Wildly imaginative, really interesting.."" so proclaimed Barack Obama about this trilogy. From what I can gather after reading this book, I already wholeheartedly agree. is a truly unique and original science fiction within the realm of plausibility. Melding real-world science, history, philosophy, religion and fantastical ideas, this novel delivers a beautifully-written (and translated) narrative which engages the mind, heart and soul.

The story starts against the backdrop of the brutal Chinese Cultural Revolution, which afforded a highly relatable and realistic basis for its central plot. The narrative combines both present time events and flashbacks to provide the backstory of a major character who suffered through that bloodshed period. Characterisation might take a slight backseat to the plot development, but I enjoyed the unfolding of the story together with the scientific bits so much that it did not become an issue for me.

It is also actually quite frightening how much I identify with the ideology presented in this thought-provoking novel. Is humanity worth salvation with the destructiveness it presents to this wondrous planet?


I opted to write a shorter review for this simply because part of my enjoyment was derived from knowing as little as possible. It was timely that I recently had the impetus to read up on theoretical and astrophysics as this helped my (little) understanding of the science in the novel. Having said that, one does not need to really know or fully comprehend the technical details to appreciate the story. However, if you are a fan of science, fiction or otherwise, who will love to see the application of these fundamental theories in a captivating story, do yourself a favour and pick up this book sooner than later.

"This book is so FREAKING AWESOME! DAMN! If all science fiction books were like this, I might not ever read another genre! Therefore, I'm glad most are not written like this, because there are so many other good books out there too. Still though, wow!




So, this is some serious science fiction. If you're familiar with physics, you've probably heard of the Three-Body Problem in which one is unable to predict subsequent motions of three bodies acting on each other, from their initial velocities and positions. The three-body problem in this book affects inhabitants of the alien planet Trisolaris, named such because it has 3 suns. Trisolarians are unable to predict where the suns will be at any time. This is cause for great alarm and fear, as each time the 3 suns are all visible in their sky, life is all but obliterated and civilizations collapse. These periods are known as Unstable Eras and are followed by Stable Eras where life once again arises and intelligent beings begin the process of creating a civilization anew.

Back on Earth, Chinese scientists have found a way to transmit messages into space using the sun to amplify them. One of their messages reaches Trisolaris, whose intelligent life forms are seeking another habitable planet to take over.

I don't want to go into too much detail, partly because I don't want to give anything away, and partly because there's just so MUCH in this book that it's hard to know what all to start with. Liu Cixin explores so many intriguing and mind-blowing ideas. There is also Chinese history interwoven through the story, especially concerning the Cultural Revolution. Occasionally the translation seemed a bit off, but that is probably because of the different writing styles of Chinese and Western writers. All in all, this is an exciting and un-put-downable book. I was quickly pulled into it and just never wanted to stop reading it. Thankfully there are 2 more books in the series that I will hopefully get a chance to read soon!

I highly recommend this book to fans of hard science fiction. If I could give this 50 stars, I would. 5 will have to suffice. Love, love, love!

"""To effectively contain a civilization's development and disarm it across such a long span of time, there is only one way; kill its science.""

The only thing that I knew about this book prior to reading it was that it revolves around alien invasion. So I prepared myself for spaceship, some cool weapons and amazing battle scenes. All in all I was looking for Guardians of the Galaxy in book form. But how wrong I was! I am so glad that all my hopes were dashed within first few chapters.

What started from cultural revolution of China soon became a tug of war between two factions. One that want an alien invasion as human race must be cleared from earth for Earth's survival, the other is trying tk stop this invasion (this group consists of most of the powerful nations of the world).

I am not a huge fantasy fan, in fact I am a beginner in this genre. The only other sci-fi that I have read is The Fifth Season. While I was super impresses with that one, this one just crossed all limits of my imagination with it's world and use of science.

The author has used many amazing concepts in this book like dehydration, rehydration, three body game, dimensions greater than three and many more. I also loved how Liu told us about ""Trisolaris"". He just didn't dump all the information at once. He took his sweet time telling us about this alien race. Though this book use tons of physics terms and it can be scary initially but the notes at the end help readers a lot to understand them.

I thought all this was awe-inspiring until I read about ""Sophon"". What a concept! It was absolutely brilliant and scary at the same time. Hope this never become a reality.

The only thing that me give this four instead of five stars is characters. I feel they're weak.

Despite all this brilliance I simply cannot let go of the thought if the human race has really crossed all limits? And is now emotionless and self-centred that earth must be purged of it for earth's survival?

Immensely enjoyable and highly recommended.

Here I quote:




Plus based on this trilogy? That's so fucking shameful.

I did read some of the quotes from his books, his mentality of 'For the greater good and/or the survival of the human race/the specie, individuals and their rights can be sacrificed', 'reality and/or society cannot be changed' is really, really fucked up in my eyes. If anyone happened to agree with such mentality, I suggest them to move to North Korea or China, I bet they will be right at home there.

When I read this 2019 New York Time article, it's mentioned that in the trilogy there is a scene with the MCs saw a bunch of school kids, but they could only save 3 kids; so one of the MCs decided the 3 kids who got saved were the 3 kids who could answer 3 math problems correctly the fastest. And then this MC righteously justified his/her decision with something similar to 'competition is good for survival'.

In fact, I can understand, to a degree, that harsh situation requests difficult and heartbreaking choices, but...how narrow-minded can these people's method and mindset be? Only the 3 kids who are the best at mathematics deserve to live, but not the kids who are good at languages and culture, interpersonal skill and leadership, etc etc?

I found this attitude really arrogant and narrow-minded.

I know, I know many people don't give a shit about authors' real life behaviors and speeches, many people only want to enjoy a good story or two. But...would you please just pause for a second and think about exactly what kind of people and their wallets you are supporting with your hard earned money?

PS: as to the translator of this book, it's one Ken Liu who I'd sworn I will never touch anything by this person after I read his less than impressive and his godawful BS.



The first ever Chinese sci-fi novel to win Hugo Award and the trilogy got translated into English in no time and there're even talks about possibly Hollywood movie deal! must be something right?

But the problem is, I'm not a huge sci-fi fan. Cyber-punk is alright with me, but old schooled sci-fi is not.

And I'm not terribly interested in or 'the commercial action of neither. So maybe I'll just let this one pass and go back to read some other older and more familiar Chinese sci-fi novels.

PS: I'd heard that younger generation of Chinese sci-fi novelists have always been hard at work and some of them managed to produce good works, but sadly I'm also not terrible interested in novels from Chinese mainland in general.

"Deja am trecut-o pe raftul special, cu foarte puține cărți de altfel, dedicat capodoperelor SF. În mod sigur cel mai bun SF citit de mine anul acesta și probabil în top 5 Cele mai bune cărți SF citite vreodată.

"ARC received via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review

The Three-Body Problem is a very successful trilogy in China and is now translated and published in English for the first time.

We're following two main characters over two different time periods. The first is Ye Wenjie who witnesses the death of her father, a scientist, during the cultural revolution in China during the 1960s.
A scientis herself she then gets the chance to participate in a high security project for the government, despite her anti-government attitude.
Our second protagonist is Wang Miao, also a scientist, who lives in modern times and gets involved with a police investigation related to some strange suicides in the scientific community. During the course of the investigation, Wang discovers a mysterious video game called The Three-Body Problem and starts to play it.
How Ye, Wang and the game are connected will get clear during the novel.

The book reads a lot like a thriller and the SF elements are rare, but when they happen they always have significance.
While reading it, the book hovered around 3,5 - 4 stars for me for a long time. But in the end the book offers you some clues and if you can connect those, you're going to see what a well constructed piece of art the novel is.
It is one of those books that really functions on a meta level and you need to do a little bit of analysis and interpretation to get the full level of enjoyment out of it.
With its symbolism in numbers it reminded me a lot of reading Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series, cause he constructs his stories in a similar way and the reader has a bit of work to do.
But I personally enjoy those engaging reads and The Three-Body Problem was a book I often set aside after finishing a chapter to think about it and that is always a good sign for a great reading experience.

In the end, this was a clear 5 star book for me and I'm really looking forward to the release of the second book in 2015.

"How would humanity react if we found out we are not alone in the universe? Not only that, if we knew that alien civilization was on its way to earth to invade our planet? How would we react? How would YOU react?

The Three-Body Problem is a unique sci-fi novel set in China. It takes place over several time periods from the 1960's to present time. The story begins during the Chinese Cultural Revolution in the late 1960's, and focuses on how the intellectual society was hard-pressed and assaulted. Those who were not killed were humiliated and sent to labor camps to be 'reformed'. This part of the story follows the life of Ye Wenjie. An astrophysicist and one of the intellectuals sent to be reformed. Ye Wenjie's experiences during this time are sad and lonely, but lead her to play a key role in the future of earth.

Part II of the story flashes forward 40 years to introduce a new character. Wang Miao is a Nanomaterials researcher who suddenly finds his life turned upside down. He is thrust into a society with elite scientists and top military personnel. Wang is not sure what is happening, but soon finds out he is to play a pivotal role in the future of how the human civilization will try to survive the impending alien invasion.



Liu Cixin has developed a very impressive sci-fi novel that takes root from actual events from Chinese history. His overwhelming knowledge of science and human nature are probably the best I have read in this genre. I would describe this as a slow burn and it may not appeal to all readers. I didn’t mind the slow pace and enjoyed reading about the science and mathematical parts in the story. Although, I will admit, it was over my head in some areas and I did feel out of my element a time or two. These sections didn’t last long, but left me wondering if I had just missed out on a vital part of the story. Luckily, that was not the case….I think.

This is the hardest book I have reviewed in a long time. I can't seem to put my experience into words the way I want to. I didn't take as many notes as usual, but that's because I was so entranced with my reading. That is probably the best way I can get my experience across. I have spoken with several people that loved it and several others that didn't, so it really comes down to personal preference. If you enjoy sci-fi then you must give this a try, and find out for yourself.

"It was a slog to get through this acclaimed, award winning book and I wondered why it was so hard for me to read. Finally, a Chinese reader's review clarified it for me: it is like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" if it had been written by the author of ""50 Shades of Grey"" (in the sense of ham handed awkward prose.)

True confession: I can't stand 2001 and it was written by Arthur C Clarke, a master of the craft. Both stories use characters and events to express their ideas about science and First Contact, never developing either. Most of the characters are disposable and the events are forced and unnatural in service of the idea/philosophy.

The second book in the trilogy is supposed to be breathtaking and amazing but I am not sure I care enough to attempt it.

"The Three-Body Problem: Particle physics, the rise and fall of civilizations, and alien contact
Originally published atFantasy Literature
The Three-Body Problem was first published in China back in 2008 and translated into English in 2014. It got a lot of attention and was put on the Hugo Award ballot this year when another author pulled out. Cixin Liu’s book has a lot going on and requires your full attention. So after listening to the audiobook during a trip to the East Coast I realized I couldn’t write a proper review, and decided to listen to it again. I’m glad I did, because this book is bursting with fascinating ideas about the rise and fall of civilizations, virtual-reality gaming, mind-blowing particle physics, the lonely life of scientists and intellectuals, the madness of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and alien contact as well.

This book is impossible to discuss without significant spoilers, so if you are interested in it since it was put on the Hugo ballot, or you like hard-SF alien contact stories, or you just want to see what the most popular Chinese SF book is about, then read no further and get the book. It is well worth your time. A detailed discussion of the plot (with unavoidable spoilers) has been placed at the end of this review.

The Three-Body Problem is split into three main narratives:

1) The backstory of scientist Ye Wenjie, who grew up during the madness of the Cultural Revolution and saw her father killed for his scientific ideas. She ends up grudgingly working at a secret military facility in the 1970s dedicated to making alien contact, but never has trust in humanity after suffering various betrayals.

2) The modern-day story of Wang Miao, a scientist studying nano-fibers, who is dragged into an investigation of a string of mysterious suicides among prominent particle physics researchers. His tale takes up the bulk of the book, and for much of the novel both he and the reader are in the dark as to what is going on. The further he gets involved with the secretive group The Frontiers of Science, the more he realizes that there are numerous conspiracies occurring, all involving scientists, alien contact, and a mysterious game called Three Body.

3) The virtual reality game called Three Body, in which players can observe and try to influence the course of an alien civilization in a far-off world that has three suns orbiting in a non-stable configuration. Because of the suns’ irregular behavior, the planet’s civilizations must struggle to advance during brief stable eras before the suns approach or recede and usher in chaotic eras, destroying all life. To survive this, the aliens develop the ability to dehydrate and wait until the next stable era. However, these eras are so unpredictable that 180 civilizations have already been destroyed, but still they try to advance their scientific knowledge in order to solve the Three-Body Problem.

Overall, I thought The Three-Body Problem was chock full of cool ideas about science but was fairly weak in characterization, particularly the main character Wang Miao, who is a fairly passive guy who serves to move the story forward. Ye Wenjie is much more complex, and her betrayal of humanity is believable considering what she has suffered. I liked the cynical and profane cop Shi Quang best, as he continually ridicules the milque-toast concerns of Wang Miao and the other scientists who seem very quick to commit suicide when their experimental results go haywire.

The most poorly executed part of the book was the virtual reality game Three Body, as it was so unclear about who was controlling the avatars, what the purpose of the game was, who created it, and whether the human participants were actually able to affect the outcome. Moreover, it was hard to believe that anyone would like to play such an esoteric and turgid game. Perhaps these mysteries have been left there deliberately to be revealed in the later books, but it was a bit confusing and took up a lot more pages than necessary.

The last 100 pages or so from the Trisolarans’ perspective was my favorite part of the book, since it dealt with mind-blowing particle physics and multiple dimensions. It was something of an info-dump, but cleared up so many earlier plot threads that I didn’t mind. Not to mention that the Trisolarans themselves are fascinating and their motivations for invasion are fairly believable, even if I question why they need bother if they have the power to create sophons.

I thought the translation by Ken Liu, author of The Grace of Kings in his own right, was done fairly well, although it’s basically impossible to judge unless you can also read Chinese fluently and can compare with the original. The writing sounded natural and the lack of embellished language is almost certainly the style of Cixin Liu, considering his interest in particle physics and admiration for Arthur C. Clarke. I imagine it’s a pretty tough novel to translate and I think Ken Liu did it justice. Notably, the second book is being translated by Joel Martinsen, so it will be interesting to see what he brings to the story. The third book, I’ve heard, will be done by Ken Liu, but that may not be accurate.

Finally, since I listened to the audiobook narrated by Luke Daniels, I have to give him full credit for handling the Chinese names well (as far as I could tell) and also for giving distinct voices to a number of characters who really wouldn’t have stood out at all otherwise. I noticed that the narrators for the next book are also different, so both translator and narrator are not the same.

I will definitely be looking forward to the next installment, The Dark Forest, which will be available on Audible on Aug 11, 2015. I also wouldn’t mind if The Three-Body Problem wins the Hugo Award this year, but I haven’t read the other contenders.

I wanted to discuss the plot in greater detail in a way that will spoil it, so if you’re interested in that, please read on:

"Brilliant and thrilling, fun and mind expanding. If this is what Chinese science fiction writers bring to the table, feed my head! This won the Hugo Award for 2015, a fitting outcome to the controversies surrounding the controversies around their selection process.

This tale deals with the classic issue of first contact with an alien civilization. The plot evolves as a mystery that engages a nanotech scientist Wang. He starts to encounter strange phenomena such as a progression of numbers appearing on his camera film. It suggests to him some form of a countdown, and he gets warnings to stop his research in creating super-strong materials. He also gets disturbed by suspicious deaths of prominent scientists and clues that link to the activities of an elusive group concerned with stopping human environmental devastation. He makes an unlikely partnership with a tough, uneducated police lieutenant whose pragmatism and humor makes for a great balance to all the scientists in the story. Wang’s investigations lead him to an online computer game called “The Three-Body Problem”, which engages players in a virtual world where scientific prediction of the classic conundrum is of critical importance to a civilization’s survival in a situation where a planet’s orbit in a three-star configuration is disastrously unstable.

Wang’s story interweaves with historical events experienced by Ye Wenije, a female astrophysicist whose academic father was killed in the Cultural Revolution and has found refuge in a secret project on a remote mountaintop base called Red Coast. There she was involved with the Chinese equivalent of the SETI project, scanning the spectra and regions of outer space for signatures of extraterrestrial intelligence. She is especially gifted in her innovations in how to amplify signals and, most significantly, sending messages back.

Saying anything more will spoil the fun. I will say the plot evolves less around the aliens themselves than how Earth’s societies and peoples would react to knowledge of an alien civilization, both in terms of perceived benefits and projected threats. I was fascinated by Liu’s exploration of how different factions would respond emotionally and spiritually and in terms of actions to defend against dangers and harness any benefits for the good of all or of only a subset of the human race. We saw a bit of that in Sagan’s “Contact” and a lot more in a favorite of mine, Niven and Pournelle’s “The Mote in God’s Eye.” I look forward to the two sequels to this novel.

Liu has been quoted in interviews as saying: “Everything that I write is a clumsy imitation of Arthur C. Clarke,” That is a fair perspective and warning to those considering reading this who don’t often read science fiction. I’d say his characters are a bit more colorful and engaging than Clarke’s, though still not up to broader literary standards. In a tailpiece written for the 2014 translation of this 2006 book, Liu provides some interesting background to his interest in writing science fiction. Sputnik, the hunger for science in the recovery from the Cultural Revolution, the ferment of his mind from math and astronomy, and his personal humbling about the fragility of humanity in response to a 1975 flood and dam failures that destroyed his town and killed over 200,000 people. I appreciate the wonder and humility of these words:

"OH WOW!!! This is like science fiction I have never read before. Although, ultimately, the book leads toward the humans seeking alien contact, as has been done many times before, the setup here is amazing.

The majority of the novel is played in two separate worlds - sort of. Although the action takes place on Earth, in China, a lot of the story revolves around an online game that creates a new immersive universe for the user. This game is a first-player historical game where the player is dropped onto an unknown planet and is completely left to their own devices without any knowledge of what to do or what is the premise of the game. Like many of today's games, the player needs to learn as they move forward to acquire the skills of communication and the knowledge of events. However, the consequences of decisions are far more reaching than those you make on your PS5 or X-Box.

The book starts off purely as a historical novel based in China. The violence and Government control form the basis for what is to evolve. At times there is some confusion due to an abundance of characters but I urge you all to push through as it definitely becomes clearer. The only thing I found hard to ascertain was the nature of civilisation outside of China. While there are several mentions of The United Staes and Britain and discussions around their warfare abilities, there never seems to be a clear indication of their current circumstances - are they powerful nations as we know them or have the scales of power swung?

So, in closing, you are met with a realistic online game, cultural Chinese history, science way beyond our current means, attempted Alien contact, splinter groups for and against human survival, well-known historical figures of the Western world and the core Three Body Problem which may or may not be solvable. Confused? I hope so because then you will love this book and how it evolves. I just need to get onto the second volume.

"In the late 1960s, Ye Wenjie gets sent to the boonies to ""atone"" for all her capitalist and intellectual sins, as perceived during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. In spite of her efforts to keep her head down, she still gets accused of political betrayal, and incarcerated. Just when Ye is certain her life is over, she gets the unexpected opportunity to redeem herself, by participating in a top secret scientific mission.

40 years later, Wang Miao is a nanotechnology researcher, who gets entangled in the investigation of multiple suicides among elite theoretical scientists. Before he can properly take on his role, he suddenly starts seeing an eerie sequence of numbers on all photos that he takes. Stressed beyond belief, Wang finds unexpected relief in playing a mysterious VR game, called .



I was pleasantly surprised by everything that the story offered, starting with the initial historical setting, following with the plot and ending with the ingenious technical solutions used by the characters to overcome their... obstacles, let's say. And I for the game-play sequences, sincerely excited to see where the players' choices would lead them.

I found the story rather hard to follow. It was nowhere near linear, had some truly monotonous excerpts from official documents, and it kept going off on numerous scientific tangents. To be fair, I can now see , but during the reading experience, I would often get confused or bored, and would eventually have to take a break from the book.



my utter lack of Physics background. I went through the requisite 6 years of middle- and high school science-major curriculum, plus some moderately high level Maths in university... but I can't say I any of it. So my mind kept wandering off during many of the scientific explanations, which had me constantly re-read lengthy mathematical explanations. All this, just so I could get a half-way decent picture in my head.



the story required 110% of my attention-span, but it had me use an additional 40%. Not a state my mind is normally accustomed to, so ""calibration"" efforts took some time. Yes, once I managed to devote sufficient attention the story, it became utterly addictive, having me pick up the sequel almost immediately.



At the same time, I couldn't help but wonder:
- is everyone so much more science savvy?
- or did they just skip a lot of the technical reasoning??
- if so... what was there left to ???
- ... or am I just off base here????
So many existential questions without answer.

"¿Te encanta la CF Hard? Enhorabuena, este libro lo disfrutas fijo.
¿Te encantan los personajes bien construidos?. Ya lo siento, aquí no pillas ni uno.
¿Y una historia original? Por aquí bien, muy bien.
¿Ritmo ágil y que engancha? Para mí no, aunque he leído opiniones de todo.

Recordemos que Liu Cixin ha ganado todo lo ganable en la CF china y que está consiguiendo adeptos a marchas forzadas en Occidente. Incluido el Hugo 2015 por este libro.

En esta novela, en tiempo actual, aparecen muertos científicos de primer orden mientras la narración da saltos desde el 2007 hasta el 1967 en plena Revolución Cultural comunista. Y la historia avanza metiendo personajes, necesarios pero sin nitidez, que nos llevan a una búsqueda de señales extraterrestres.

¿Lo mejor? Sin duda las ideas científicas, originales pero precisas, o actualmente reales o fácilmente creíbles (bueno, ejem, el sofón lo dejamos aparte, ¿vale?). Me ha encantado la imagen visual del barco en el canal (no puedo aclarar más sin hacer spoiler del horror).

Como ni los personajes ni el ritmo narrativo me han gustado le daría 5/10 ...pero la idea es tan buena y las partes de ciencia tan atractivas le subo al 7/10. Y en estrellitas cuatro porque tres me parecen poco.

Eso sí, no recomiendo este libro a no ser que te vaya el rollo Ciencia.

No me he convertido en converso del Cixin, ¡cachis!, con lo que me gusta descubrir nuevos autores que me embelesen. Liu va a ser que no entra en ese grupo.

"The Three-Body Problem is science fiction at its best. Most science fiction doesn't even discuss any science. Here is science in all its beauty, majesty and wonder combined with human politics and history. It is a master work that I was almost afraid to read. I thought the material would be too hard to understand, but Cixin Liu has a way of explaining and expressing himself which makes it easier. The book is not just a discourse on why we try to understand the building blocks of life, but why it's important and vital to our survival.

"Празнотата не е тъждествена с нищото. Празнотата представлява съществуване, с което изпълваш себе си.“


„Трите тела“ е страшно въздействаща и качествена научна фантастика! Впечатлен съм от майсторския начин, по който Лиу е преплел значими научни и социални теми, както и отправил критика към китайския манталитет. На пръв поглед книгата осъжда влиянието на компютърните игри и не изглежда опасна за тоталитарната власт, но при задълбочен прочит дава многопластова картина на китайските обществени проблеми... Мисля че по силата на вложените послания, китайският писател достойно се нарежда до големите братя Стругацки!

В сюжета основно се разглежда зараждането на предстоящ в бъдещето сблъсък между човечеството и по-развита чуждопланетна цивилизация и увлекателно се п��пуляризират науките, но същевременно се прокрадва и описание на зловещата културна революция в Китай. Въпреки сложните научни идеи, романът представлява съвсем разбираемо и поучително четиво за човешката същност...





„В Китай всяка по-възвишена мисъл е обречена да се сгромоляса на земята. Гравитационното поле на реалността е твърде силно.“


„Човешкото невежество недостатък ли е или предимство от гледна точка на еволюцията?“


„Светът се задвижва от балансираното взаимодействие между ин и ян. Това движение не може да се контролира, но може да се предвиди.“


„Женското мислене е различно от мъжкото, което не означава, че едното е по-висше от другото. И двете са необходими на света.“


„Най-големият ужас за псевдоучените са един друг вид хора, които трудно се хващат на въдицата: магьосниците. Повечето псевдонаучни измами са разобличавани именно от магьосници.“


„Модзъ си беше източен мислител. Чисто и просто мистик в наметало на учен. Той така и не взе резултатите от наблюденията си на сериозно и моделът му се основаваше единствено на субективни предположения. Голяма смехория!“


„Да, бях открил празнотата и сега можех да се оттегля в града. Дори насред шума на тълпите вътре в себе си щях да съм безмерно спокоен.“


„Европейската мъдрост е страшна работа. Не че сте по-умни от азиатците, просто умеете да откривате правилните пътища.“


„ Аз я забелязах случайно на компютъра на внука – каза старият философ, като вдигна мундщука на лулата си. – Младокът се пробва два-три пъти и я заряза, много сложна му била, а мен ме запали тъкмо със сложността си, със страховитата си, но естетска атмосфера, със солидната логика на създадения свят, с прецизността на детайлите и огромното количество информация, скрита под простата и изчистена повърхност.“


„Благодарение на все по-близките си отношения с Ян Уей-нин тя успя да си набави много чуждоезични философски и исторически класики, винаги под предлог, че събира научни материали. Кървавите петна по човешката история я потрисаха, а блестящите мисли на философите ѝ сочеха най-съществената и най-прикриваната част на човешката природа.“


„Отчуждението, предизвикано от вродените дефекти на човечеството; копнежът по един по-добър свят и благоговението пред по-висшата цивилизация; мечтата потомците да оцелеят в голямата война – тези три импулса доведоха до скоростното разрастване на земното трително движение. И то достигна огромни мащаби още преди да бъде забелязано.“


„Да не забравяме най-важното: технологичното развитие като цяло е зависимо от фундаменталните изследвания, а те се основават на проучванията на дълбинния строеж на материята.“

"Съвременната научна фантастика е рядкост на българския книжен пазар и излизането на всеки по-мащабен труд в този жанр е истинско събитие. То е двойно по-голямо, ако говорим за най-нашумелия в момента китайски фантаст Лиу Цъсин. Романът му „Трите тела“, книга първа от трилогията „Земното минало“, ще бъде по книжарниците съвсем скоро с логото на издателство „Колибри“ в превод от китайски език на Стефан Русинов.

Сред известните почитатели на трилогията са Барак Обама, Марк Зукърбърг и изненадващо, или може би не чак толкова, половината висши китайски партийни функционери. Самият Цъсин споделя в някои от интервютата си, че се е притеснявал от евентуална цензура на романа, защото той включва крайно чувствителната тема за Културната революция, проведена под егидата на Мао Дзъдун. Опасенията му обаче се оказват безпочвени и „Земното минало“ печели най-престижната китайска награда в областта на научната фантастика – отличието „Галактика“, както и видно място в библиотеките на милиони китайци.

Днес трилогията е преведена на над двадесет езика, а продажбите й надхвърлят осем милиона копия в световен мащаб. Трилогията е посветена на една от култовите за научната фантастика по цял свят теми – първи контакт с извънземна цивилизация. Обещаващото начало на това приключение, поставено в ""Трите тела"", включва преобръщането нагоре с краката на разнообразни физични закони, разнообразни късчета китайска история, която е вмъкната безкрайно плавно в наратива, световна история (на страниците на книгата се срещаме с имена като Айнщайн, Нютон, Лайбниц, поставени в крайно необичайните условия на симулирана реалност), онлайн компютърна игра, на чиято технология могат да завидят и най-известните имена от Силициевата долина, както и чудесни тактически военни маневри, необходими на земляните за справянето с бъдещото нашествие на враждебните същества от Трителната система.

Няма как да не бъдат казани и няколко думи за нея, защото тя дава наименованието на целия роман. Заглавието идва от аналитичния проблем в орбиталната механика, който касае прецизното изчисляване на движението на три тела, разположени така, че гравитацията на всяко едно от тях влияе и на трите едновременно. Прочитайки научна статия, посветена на този проблем, Лиу Цъсин си задава въпросите: ""Ами ако тези три тела всъщност представляват три слънца? Как ще се развие интелигентен живот на планета, която е част от подобна слънчева система?"". Оттук нататък структурата на романа започва малко по-малко да придобива форма.

"The Three-Body Problem exists as a vast, complex 4 dimensional object. Much of its byzantine structures are veiled behind the plane of a different reality of language, culture, and regime. As a western reader I am appreciative of the dazzling parts I can see which intersect with my space. My curiosity about the unified whole easily forgives the parts I found mildly unpleasant - Some of the dialogue is stilted and scenes contrived. These minor imperfections do not detract from the scope and crystal beauty of the Hard Science Fiction awesomeness delivered.

"Esta novela comienza durante la Revolución Cultural, un período de fanatismo en el que la República Popular China se convirtió esencialmente en un culto a la personalidad de Mao Zedong. El culto a Mao dominó todas las facetas de la vida de la gente, buscando borrar todos los aspectos no comunistas de la historia y la cultura chinas, a través de medios violentos si era necesario. Por supuesto, esto también significó un control estricto sobre el sistema educativo chino para impedir la enseñanza de ideas contrarrevolucionarias.

En este contexto de la Revolución Cultural, el padre de Ye Wenjie es un destacado profesor de física en la prestigiosa Universidad Tsinghua de Beijing. Está a la vanguardia de su campo, enseñando teorías fundamentales de la física moderna, como la relatividad general y la mecánica cuántica. Su aceptación de la ciencia occidental (incluido el trabajo de Einstein y Bohr) lo lleva a ser acusado de abrazar ideologías reaccionarias. Estudiantes de la Guardia Roja lo matan a golpes delante de su aterrorizada hija. La propia Ye Wenjie más tarde es perseguida y encarcelada por abrazar el pensamiento occidental. La salvan dos científicos militares que trabajan en la Costa Roja, un programa espacial ultrasecreto del gobierno chino, que reconocen las destacadas habilidades de Ye Wenjie como física.

La idea central de “El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos” se basa directamente en el clásico de ciencia ficción de Stanisław Lem de 1961, “Solaris”, que analiza si un planeta que orbita alrededor de dos soles puede sustentar la evolución de la vida. En “Solaris”, los dos soles tienen intensidades muy diferentes, lo que hace que el clima del planeta en órbita, llamado Solaris, varíe drásticamente dependiendo de cuál de los dos soles esté actualmente más cerca. Las fluctuaciones climáticas resultantes arrojan dudas sobre si el planeta tiene un clima lo suficientemente consistente como para sustentar la evolución biológica, que requiere una relativa estabilidad climática durante millones de años.

En “El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos”, Liu Cixin sube la apuesta al introducir un tercer sol en el problema. La trayectoria orbital de un planeta alrededor de tres soles plantea un complejo problema matemático que ha eludido solución durante cientos de años. En esta novela, el planeta en órbita, Trisolaris, experimenta períodos de relativa estabilidad interrumpidos por períodos de repentino caos climático.

A lo largo de su historia planetaria, Trisolaris ha pasado por cientos de períodos estables, en los que la sociedad ha alcanzado distintos niveles de desarrollo científico y tecnológico, para luego ser aniquilada por cambios climáticos repentinos. Los trisolarianos han desarrollado la capacidad de deshidratarse para sobrevivir durante estos períodos de caos, pero finalmente han determinado que la única forma en que su sociedad puede sobrevivir a largo plazo es colonizar otro planeta habitable con un clima más estable. Comparado con Trisolaris, el punto azul pálido que conocemos como La Tierra parece bastante atractivo.

Más allá de su excelente tratamiento de los principios científicos, “El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos” plantea varias cuestiones filosóficas importantes, siendo la más profunda: ¿Vale la pena salvar a la humanidad? A medida que Ye Wenjie se convierte en una de las principales científicas en busca de vida extraterrestre, sus experiencias durante la Revolución Cultural han moldeado sus puntos de vista sobre el valor de la humanidad.

Aunque “Solaris” y “El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos” comienzan esencialmente con la misma premisa, “El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos” tiene éxito en aspectos en los que “Solaris” falla. Mientras que “Solaris” cae rápidamente en la pseudociencia, “El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos” se basa en principios científicos en gran medida creíbles. Liu Cixin inyecta a la trama grandes dosis de entrelazamiento cuántico realista, teoría de la información, nanotecnología y física de partículas. Uno de los conceptos más interesantes propuestos por él es una nueva partícula subatómica llamada ""sofón"", que puede cambiar de dimensionalidad como forma de almacenar información. Más allá de las ciencias puras, Liu Cixin también maneja brillantemente cuestiones de sociología, especialmente en relación con la Revolución Cultural y su impacto en la psicología humana y las decisiones tomadas por personajes individuales.

La historia en sí se cuenta desde múltiples puntos de vista a lo largo de varias décadas. Cambios tan drásticos en la perspectiva y el marco temporal podrían desorientar a manos menos capaces, pero Liu Cixin maneja hábilmente estas transiciones, usándolas como una forma efectiva de construir una narrativa más amplia.

Esta es ciencia ficción pura, llena de largos y amorosos pasajes de exposición técnica sobre todo, desde la mecánica cuántica hasta la inteligencia artificial. Pero Liu Cixin respalda toda esa teoría retorcida con personajes empáticos y una fuerte columna vertebral de suspenso y acción. Hay mucho que preparar, y “El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos” se tambalea un poco hasta que encuentra su equilibrio. La historia comienza lentamente a pesar de sus muchos avances cronológicos, y lleva un tiempo desenredar exactamente quiénes o cuáles se supone que son los puntos focales de la trama. Sin embargo, una vez que está en funcionamiento, es apasionante.

A pesar de su atractivo universal, “El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos” se sitúa en un contexto específico, uno que la mayoría de los lectores occidentales sólo conocen de lejos. Muchos de sus puntos principales dependen del conocimiento de la historia y la cultura chinas, y si bien la traducción es clara, elegante y lírica, hay mucha exposición para analizar. Vale la pena cada gramo de esfuerzo. El bien merecido suspenso del libro gira en torno a dilemas morales que resuenan mucho más allá de su nacionalidad o incluso de su embriagadora y abstracta física. ¿En qué momento la ciencia se convierte en dogma y en qué momento ese mismo dogma se convierte en religión?

Liu Cixin no plantea esa pregunta sino que deja que se desarrolle en un drama radical que apunta a los riesgos más altos imaginables, y algunos que apenas pueden imaginarse. Si “El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos” ayuda a cerrar la brecha entre la ciencia ficción oriental y occidental, habrá cumplido un gran deber para el mundo literario. Pero como epopeya de ciencia ficción del tipo más profundo, ya ha ganado.

"Gah. Life's too short to torture myself further with this book. Adieu, overhyped book that makes me question my sanity (seriously, how are people loving this book? how?!). Adieu, flatness and boringness and sexist stuff. Adieu, adieu. This book was so painful to get through - and I was having so much cognitive dissonance about how it's Nebula-nominated and people luv-luv-luvvvv it - that I'm starting to feel crazy, like, do I actually books?! Am I sure about this science fiction thing?!

Sheesh. Let me just put this down and walk away.

"‘The Three-Body Problem’ is a science fiction novel by Cixin Liu. The premise is not original but the way Liu writes is incredibly creative; he makes the tale of first contact with aliens uniquely his own. This book fascinated me in the same way that Philip K. Dick’s ‘The Minority Report’ and the film, ‘Total Recall’ based on another Philip K. Dick story does. There’s something shiny and awesome about science and technology that draws me in for a closer look. Cixin Liu’s world is approachable. It’s a world filled with academia and nerdy scientists working on ‘the next big thing.’ However this story’s roots are in the past, in late 1960s Mao Zedung’s Cultural Revolution.

One of the opening scenes is a traumatic ‘struggle session,’ where Professor Ye Zhetai is berated, publicly humiliated, and so much worse by his wife and students. Many academics and intellectuals during this time chose suicide over the gauntlet of a struggle session. One of the main characters of this novel is Ye Wenjie, daughter of Professor Ye Zhetai. She is present at her father’s ‘struggle session’ and traumatized by what happens. This and other incidents become the psychological background of a decision she will make that will affect the destiny of the human race. She becomes an astrophysicist, eventually landing at Red Coast Base, whose true goal is purposefully obfuscated.

In the story’s present time (somewhere around 2006), there is a flux of scientists committing suicide. Policemen show up at Wang Miao’s apartment to command his presence at an important meeting. Wang Miao is an important scientist in the field of nanotechnology; he's developing a special nanomaterial with superpowers. Wang Miao’s appointments for that day have already been rescheduled by the investigators. One of the policemen is Captain Shi Qiang, who is rough, tough, blustery, and rude. He has a bad reputation but he’s one of those people that can see beyond the trees to envision the entire forest, so his expertise is sought after. Shi Qiang is my favorite character. He provides relief, often humorous, from the dark, frowny, too burdened intellectuals. Shi Qiang and Wang Miao rub each other the wrong way at first, but Shi Qiang grew on Wang Miao just like he did me.

The first half of the story is excellently paced. I found myself pouring through the pages. The pacing slowed down for me when Wang Miao is introduced to the game called three-body. Some readers will not find this problematic. At about two-thirds in, I discovered the Chinese TV series based on this book at viki.com. Seeing a visual interpretation of the game sequences enhanced my interest in those sections.

It’s difficult to rate a book like this one, which has an epic quality to it. Cixin Liu is a computer engineer and the most popular writer of science fiction in China. He made me feel awe and wonder at the vastness and unknowns of the universe, and curiosity about the science and technology that propels our world today. How will humans react if contact is made with extraterrestrial life? That’s part of the question that ‘The Three-Body Problem’ takes on, possibly the main question.

There was an emotional quality that was lacking for me in the narrative, but I’m reading other reviews that say this often occurs in hard science fiction. It is mostly about science and ideas. An A+ story with B- characterization, some depth, but not enough, and the story is so good, it deserved those A+ level characters.

"Debo ser sincera: no disfruto demasiado de los libros que contienen más explicaciones y énfasis en teorías que creación y desarrollo psicológico de personajes.

""El problema de los tres cuerpos"" es sin dudas una novela brillante que muestra la enorme lucidez de su autor, así como su don visionario para teorizar sobre el futuro de la humanidad a partir de la física, la tecnología y la ciencia. Sin embargo, con este libro he confirmado una vez más que yo no soy una lectora a la que le apasionen libros de ficción con más peso en la ciencia que en la parte humana de los personajes: los sentí robóticos, fríos, apáticos, como si solo fuesen una excusa para demostrar el punto al que la historia quería llegar. Esto se refuerza con la aparición de ""info-dumps"" y ciertas maneras de los ""extraterrestres"", que sonaban en exceso humanos. En el libro hay personajes más preocupados por la vida y el futuro en conjunto que por su individualidad y, a lo largo de esta historia (no sé si el autor lo hizo conscientemente así), Cixin Liu también se vuelca más en el conjunto que en la singularidad de cada uno de los individuos que intervienen.

En fin, durante el 80% de este libro sentí que estaba leyendo una historia escrita a manera de ensayo sobre física y vida extraterrestre, con algo de humanismo (sobre todo en cuanto a los problemas reales que plantea el libro, como la naturaleza violenta y destructora de la humanidad), pero sin la profundidad psicológica de una novela. La recomiendo para personas que sepan de ciencia, que no se pierdan en la cantidad de referencias y explicaciones de ese tema que hay aquí, o para quienes estén dispuestos a aceptar con paciencia todos esos tramos, porque detrás de todo eso hay inquietudes muy importantes sobre el futuro de nuestra especie.

"NYT has an article today... finishing it after I finish the book!
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/boo...

___

From the author's postscript:
""I've always felt that the greatest and most beautiful stories in the history of humanity were not sung by wandering bards or written by playwrights and novelists, but told by science. ... Only, these wonderful stories are locked in cold equations that most do not know how to read.""

Before becoming China's most popular science-fiction writer, Liu Cixin was an engineer, and his scientific and mathematical bent is clearly seen in this story. While it doesn't ignore the small things - indeed, one of the larger themes of the book is how individual actions can change the course of history - the focus is wide.

The title of the book comes from a classic problem of physics (). There is extensive discussion of this, and other ideas in physics, both direct and metaphorical, throughout the book. As the novel begins, renowned scientists, some of whom have been working on this problem, have been discovered to be killing themselves. Is there some secret that has been divulged to them that has caused them to lose all hope?

Are these deaths tied in, in some way, with a secret society tied to an organization of scientists? Is a mysterious and abstruse video game which puts the player into a virtual reality world ruled by unpredictable physics a key to what's happening?

The plot is not one that's easy to summarize - there's a lot in here. But I don't think it's giving too much away to say that this does turn out to be a first contact/threat of alien invasion story. Like many such stories, it explores how different groups of people might react to such a possibility, and how these reactions might divide society. However, I found some of the ideas here to be quite fresh and unusual. Perhaps it's a cultural difference in expectations; perhaps it's just Liu's original take on the genre.

I have to admit I was mainly drawn to the book by finding out that Liu is so popular in China, and thus was curious as to what people are reading there. This is, without doubt, a Chinese book. Translator Ken Liu (no relation to the author) notes that Chinese literature comes with a different set of readers' expectations.
To me, at times the book moved rather slowly, had extended tangents/digressions, and neglected interpersonal relationships & emotions in favor of more intellectual motivations. However, I also felt that all of these qualities were intentional on the author's part, and that some readers may see these aspects of the book as strengths.

In addition to form, the plot very explicitly deals with Chinese culture and politics - the beginning is set during the Cultural Revolution, and the horrors and traumas that his characters experience during that civil conflict set the stage for their decisions later in life.

I felt that the book was worth reading just for that - the glimpse into another perspective on history; one that may be unfamiliar to many Western readers. However, it's also a fascinating tale for anyone interested in theories about alien civilizations, and one that will be of particular interest to those with an interest in physics.

A copy of this book was provided to me by NetGalley. Many thanks. As always, my opinions are solely my own.

"Hmmm. I liked it! I don't really know what I just read but I liked it. It was an interesting cultural exploration of Chinese scifi. I learned that ""sophons"" are the ultimate spies and saboteurs. I learned that apparently the Chinese are as cynical and bitter towards the nature of mankind as...well I am. And frankly I was amused by the fatalism.
I confess, I want to see how this plays out. I'm definitely looking forward to the sequels.



Listened to the audiobook. Listening allows me to just ""go with the flow"" as far as the physics and science part of the scifi novel goes. I didn't find myself bogged down trying to figure out if it was a viable theory. Full disclosure, the explanations are lost on me anyways. Luke Daniels did an excellent job as the narrator.

"What an interesting novel. It's kind of all over the place, and that's its strength. Personally, as a fan of Chinese literature and science fiction I had to read it.

The novel is very Chinese, starting off in the Cultural Revolution era (and jumps around in time back to that era) and doesn't have a single protagonist's plot. In Chinese style, it's about bigger things, although the arc of the family is there.

The hard science fiction element is fascinating. I loved the video game scenes. Very well done. However, without giving away spoilers, the international conspiracy scenes felt rushed and too coincidental in tying up loose ends of the big mystery.

Finally, the all-out scifi scenes not on Earth were another tone entirely. It's very ambitious to fit so much, and I wasn't sure it would work, but upon reading I do feel The Three-Body Problem works. Next to read the sequel and find out what will happen next.

"Hugely disappointed because I started this with great expectations. All those amazing five star reviews - I should have taken more notice of the one and two star ones. Maybe it was because I hate physics. I gave it up as soon as I could at school. There was a lot of very thoroughly explained physics in this book. A lot.

I recognise that there was much value in the information about Chinese culture. There were moments of interest in the science fiction which to my mind were not developed enough. And the characters were not developed at all. I barely differentiated between them.

I had been looking forward to this book for ages. Oh well. You win some, you lose some.

"Three Body Problem made me curious about mathematics. This is no small feat.
I see math like Michael Bay sees movies that aren't based on a series of explosions – as something to be minimised in one’s life and if possible, completely avoided.

The titular three body problem in Cixin's book is a mind-melter of a physics conundrum where the movements of three gravitationally linked bodies are near impossible to predict. Cixin spins this problem into a fascinating scenario with an interstellar scope and blends a plausible, interesting story with some very cool mathematics and physics questions that even a die-hard math-hater like me can enjoy.

I’m probably not selling you on this book so far. Math is as enticing to most folks as a midwinter dip in a bathtub filled with chilled snot. Fear not – this is no text book. The mathy stuff is only one small part of what is an entertaining and gripping novel, written from a cultural perspective largely missing in SF.

begins with the Chinese Cultural Revolution (which Cixin evokes vividly) and its links to the death by suicide of several top scientists in contemporary China. These suicides lead Wang Miao, a nanotech researcher, to discover a threat that will not only destroy human advances in science, but also threaten to end human civilisation. Imagine the Holy Mountain chapter of David Mitchell’s , but even better, book length and written by someone whose family experienced the chaos of Mao’s China.

Being an English speaker I mostly read books that work from a western/English speaking mindset. It’s quite refreshing to read a novel where the main characters aren’t the revolving cast of Americans/Brits/Europeans and occasional Aussies that I’m used to. Cixin’s book is a great opportunity to read SF where Chinese history and concerns dominate the story, and experience a perspective where English speaking peoples/nations appear as non-central characters and locations.

This book made me antisocial. I annoyed my partner with my engrossed unresponsiveness and cut myself off for hours, avoiding phone calls and ignoring emails as I raced to find out what Cixin had in store for Miao and humanity. I’m not always stoked to discover that a book is the first in a trilogy, but I’m glad that the world of isn't finished - I’m not ready to leave it yet.

"”- Какво може да знае една буболечка?
- Но ти си буболечка физик.”

Раят на някои е ад за други. Адът на някои е рай за други. Кривите огледала понякога са неотличими от правите.

Какво е общото между буболечките, отчаяното интелектуално търсене на нов месия, културната революция и вредите от изсичането на горите? Лиу Цъсин разстила микс от жанрове пред читателя, превеждайки го от безумията на Културната революция в Китай до съвременния високоскоростен и консуматорски начин на живот, неусетно водещи до края на човешката цивилизация.

Млада астрофизичка става свидетел на бруталното убийство на баща си при изстъпленията на хунвейбините, и е заклеймена като подривен елемент. Звездите обаче в буквален смисъл и предоставят нов шанс. Къде свършва справедливостта и започва безумието?

40 години по-късно учен, участващ в разработка на наноматериали, е въвлечен в мистериозна компютърна игра за чуждопланетен свят, която поставя на изпитание цялата му научна квалификация и душевно равновесие. Междувременно се множат тайнствените самоубийства сред именити учени.

И в играта влизат изперкал, но комбинативен детектив и висшите военни.

Лиу Цъсин поднася куп научни концепции от физиката и астрономията някак между другото, игриво и увлекателно. Разсъждава над ползите и вредите от науката. Прави топла връзка с източните учения и светоглед (често срещани връзки малко-голямо, вътрешно-външно, общество-индивид, невежество-знание, сила-слабост). Громи открито Културната революция и доста по-скрито и метафорично, но все пак видимо сегашната линия в Китай. Опитва се да дефинира що е то цивилизация и ни хвърля в началото на епично приключение за цял��то човечество.

Лиу Цъсин би могъл да пише в който жанр пожелае - стилът му на писане (стегнат, компетентен, топъл) е сигурна гаранция, че винаги ще провокира и интригува читателя си, оставайки същевременно негов приятел.

Нямам търпение да прочета и следващите две части в чудесния превод на Стефан Русинов.

Even better (if that’s possible) at a second reading. You know the story, what happens, where is heading, therefore you can concentrate on the details.

It has so much harsh reality in it that makes your heart tighten. And it raises so many questions about what we have become: a species without control, without care, without vision.
Don’t we have the wisdom to change ourselves? Why are we not capable of preserving what we have? When will we be conscious how fortunate we are to live on such an amazing and unique planet?

At the end of the book, there is an afterword by the author about himself and his road on becoming the writer he is today: one of the most beautiful mini-biography read.

Somebody told me once to recommend a book and my first choice was sci-fi, but I asked first what genre she would prefer, because in sci-fi I could recommend plenty. Quite offended, she answered: ‘no, I do not read science fiction; I read only books from which I can something’. After a frozen moment, I smiled and said that I cannot recommend anything, because I read books only for fun – I don’t want to learn anything anymore, therefore I cannot help her...

I remembered this episode because there is a fragment in Liu Cixin’s postscript that is exactly about this and match my feelings to the core:
(reread from 20.08.2016 to 24.08.2016)

PS. There is also a postscript from Ken Liu which I believe it should become a mandatory reading for all translators. All should be this dedicated and have the same respect for the works which are in their responsibility.
-------------





That's pretty much the conclusion of the story, but... There is a big BUT involved: this is no common sci-fi story. It's a damn complex one.

Half of it consists in non-fiction (better said historical fiction) facts, mostly from China's recent history (the way Liu presents the horrors of Cultural Revolution in 1966 makes your skin crawl). Add to this numerous mathematical models/problems, some physics laws and you get yourself an almost hard SF opera (but, despite all the scientific concepts, it is not a heavy reading, on the contrary.)
Still, there is more - environmental issues are present as well:
And among all these earthly matters, here comes the fictional part: a virtual computer game world and a distant solar system and its civilization.
Until about 60% of the book, all the above appear to be disparate pieces of puzzle with no connection in between. It took me a week to read half of the book and just few hours to finish it after that breaking point.
It is one of the most intricate stories I have read, due to its narrative threads and characters behavior. I guess the cultural differences do have a great impact even in a tale.
And even if it's not fast-paced (at least, not in the first part), it is one heck of a reading; Liu Cixin's imagination and his brilliant way to combine the two opposite genres left me dazzled.

At the end of this book, there is a postscript from the author for the English edition in which, among a lot of his beliefs which I very much resonate with, there is also the following fragment:

"Впечатляващо добра книга. Започва от едно място с първата си част „Смълчана пролет“, където се проследяват събития от Културната революция в Китай (заглавието на първата глава тук – Безумната епоха – е изключително точно), преминава в наши дни във втората част „Трите тела“, където започват да се разгръщат множество въпроси, свързани с науката, мистерии и една любопитна игра, докато достига и до самата същина на всичко в третата си част „Залезът на човечеството“.

Самата идея за
не е нито нова, нито сензационна, обаче особеното на тази книга е пътят, по който се достига до това откритие. А той наистина е интересен и начинът, по-който се разгръща сюжетът е отличителен, завладяващ и изненадващ.

Темата за науката в книгата и ролята ѝ като цяло е прелюбопитна. А въпросите, които се поставят са значими. Докъде се простират границите на науката? Какво би се случило, ако науката, в която вярваме, изведнъж се окаже напълно погрешна? Има ли някой, чиято цел е да се дискредитират научните постижения и открития? Кой и защо? И на какво всъщност е готово човечеството, или части от него?

Силен интерес буди и играта „Трите тела“, която е от изключителна важност за ставащото. Етапите в нея бяха невероятно интересни.



Книгата повдига доста високо летвата в жанра научна фантастика. Никак не е случайно, че е спечелила толкова много литературни отличия.

"Voy a intentar no decir demasiado de la trama, porque es de esas historias que te sorprenden constantemente y cualquier cosa que sepas puede estropear la experiencia. Mientras la leía, nunca tuve una pista de hacia donde iba la historia, por más que acierte o no, siempre puedo hacerme hipótesis sobre hacia donde avanza una trama, pero con ""El problema de los tres cuerpos"" me ha sido imposible intuir, o creer intuir, nada de lo que podría pasar. Absolutamente nada me pude figurar. En mi vida he leído nada ni remotamente parecido, donde cada nuevo capítulo era una nueva sorpresa, que me volvía a descolocar, en el buen sentido, y eso es impresionante.

Uno de los temas que más me han tocado en la lectura es esa gran crítica al ser humano, como este destruye todo lo que le rodea, bajo la creencia de que el mundo le pertenece. Como desforesta los bosques por capricho, como provoca la extinción de otras especies por no considerarlas útiles para la vida humana o como sacrifica a otros por el ""bien"" común. Muchísimas reflexiones me dejaban con la boca abierta y me ponían los pelos de punta.

Otros temas muy importantes del libro son el colonianismo, el fanatismo religioso convertido en secta y los peligros que conlleva, la destrucción del medio ambiente o el avance de la ciencia como herramienta de lucha entre países, continentes o incluso planetas. Todos estos temas se mezclan perfectamente para ir creando una historia compleja y completa.

Una de las primeras cosas que me sorprendieron es que la historia parta de un hecho histórico real y durísimo como fue la Revolución Cultural China, uno de los momentos históricos donde más barbaries hicieron los seres humanos, que añade un punto más a esa visión sobre el ser humano que es capaz de todo, de las mayores brutalidades por cualquier motivo. Me encanta este periodo histórico, y ha sido todo un acierto encauzar la historia con este punto de partida.

Pese a que tiene muchos tecnicismos, pues a fin de cuenta es un libro que tiene como tema central la ciencia, y el avance de esta, nunca resulta excesivamente denso. Mentiría si dijera que no hay capítulos que se pueden hacer más complejos que otros, porque los hay, pero dentro de lo que cabe es una lectura con una narración ágil y directa, que engancha desde las primeras páginas.

El hecho de que sea tan difícil de saber hacia donde te llevan las páginas, le aporta casi un toque de suspense, de misterio, que te mantiene en tensión durante la lectura, pendiente de cada detalle para tratar de atar cabos. El final de esta novela te deja con la miel en los labios, porque pese a ser una novela espectacular, tiene un aura a introducción. Me muero de ganas de coger la segunda parte, porque el mundo que abre esta primera parece enorme y puede evolucionar hacia cualquier parte.

El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos es un libro de extremos. Con esto quiero decir que no hay una parte que deje a medias. Sus puntos fuertes, que son su historia y su ciencia, son increíbles. Sus puntos débiles, que son sus personajes y su narrativa, son espantosos. Al final la nota es alta porque los fuertes acaban sobreponiéndose a los débiles, y reconozco que la historia me ha mantenido interesado. Cixin Liu aporta un nuevo enfoque muy interesante al ya masticado tema del contacto con una civilización extraterrestre, y he de decir que me parece mucho más plausible este que cualquier otro que haya visto. ¿Sabéis lo agradable que es que unos alienígenas quieran destruirnos no porque quieran llevarse nuestra agua o porque nos consideren una especie brutal que debe ser sacrificada? No tenéis ni idea.

Espero que con este libro no sea el caso porque es, de lejos, el mejor libro que me he leído en un buen tiempo.

En EL PROBLEMA DE LOS TRES CUERPOS nos encontramos con una historia de ciencia ficción que inicia en plena Revolución Cultural en China de los 90's. Ye Wenjie, después de haber sido testigo en primera fila del asesinato de su padre (un físico de renombre), vive su vida años después en una base ""militar/científica"" que se dedica a investigar la vida extraterrestre. Ye Wenjie, quien heredó la vocación científica de su padre, tiene en las manos una oportunidad única en la vida: mandar un mensaje al espacio para que cualquier vida fuera de la tierra lo escuche. Pero decepcionada por lo que el mundo le hizo a su padre, y le está haciendo al planeta, su mensaje más allá de ser una simple bienvenida, es una súplica para que ""alguien"" venga a ayudar a la tierra.


Estoy muy consciente de (y también me lo dijeron varios cuando publiqué en mis redes que estaba leyendo este libro) que la ciencia ficción puede llegar a ser intimidante sí: 1- no estás acostumbrado al género. 2- Las ciencias no son lo tuyo. 3- Buscas más leer sobre el ""resultado"" por encima del ""proceso"". Todo eso, y más, fue lo que me tuvo reticente de empezar esta obra que tenía en mi librero desde hace AÑOS, pero quiero darte mi palabra (y apoyo) que si te decides a leer este libro, no solo no vas a tener mayor problema para entender y disfrutar, si no que te va a dejar con GANAS DE MÁS.

Es una historia dramática, con personajes ""reales"" que no son buenos ni malos, que tienen sus propios problemas e intereses, que quieren luchar pero se sienten derrotados, que de un día para otro descubren que tal vez todo lo que han conocido hasta ahora no es lo que creían, pero que no tienen tiempo para reflexionar mucho sobre ello porque el ""tiempo"" es un bien escaso en estos momentos, y que con todo eso encima no les queda otra que actuar: con errores, con miedo, con aciertos, pero con mucho interés.








Y lo que más puedo aplaudirle a Cixin Liu es que su libro no es nada denso, no le falta ni le sobra una página, sacia tu curiosidad y hasta te motiva a que averigües por tu lado; te conmueve y te obliga a ponerte en situación. Es que puedo quedarme todo el día escribiendo lo increíble que me resultó esta lectura.



Lástima que la serie en Netflix no le hace justicia.

"The Three-Body Problem is an inventive science fiction read that suffers, in my opinion, from some translation issues. None of the characters feel quite right. Their dialogue seemed wooden and stilted. And, perhaps this was just my Western mind, I never really understood some of their motivations.

pg 22

My quibbles with the characters aside, some of the concepts in this book were utterly fascinating.

There's a mysterious government installation, video game with a deeper, hidden meaning, unexplained deaths, numbers appearing out of thin air, and, my favorite part, an in-depth imagining of what unfolding a proton in different dimensions might look like. For fans of the genre, I can see why the would be appealing.

pg 61

In the library copy I read, some of the major cultural issues needed to understand the text are included in footnotes. It helped, but it made me wish I could read this in its original form.

pg 135

I particularly liked Liu Cixin's descriptions of the landscapes contained in the video game of the story. The desolate vistas and civilization-ending weather were fascinating to explore.

The idea that there was a world where the law of physics didn't apply was also mind-bending. Cixin has created a place where suns swirl through the sky in no discernible pattern and pendulums don't swing in the expected pattern. In a world like that, anything could happen. And it does.

pg 205

Recommended with reservations for fans of science fiction. There's much to enjoy in this read, especially if you favor the ""science"" part of the genre.

"I'm really shocked: after all the praise for this book and its unlikely circumstances (translated hard sci-fi achieving both commercial success and the Hugo?!), The Three-Body Problem was Real Bad. The plotting is kinda chunky, hobbled by the trilogy aspect into not working as a standalone book. The characterizations are boring at best. And the science comes off at best as Babby's First Neal Stephenson when it isn't too busy diving into pure gibberish. And that last part was the most appalling, since after setting up the first genuinely interesting mystery of the book halfway through, it resolves it by essentially resorting to magic.

I read through the whole book waiting for it to get good, thinking ""oh the mediocrity is just the story getting started,"" but it consistently got worse as it went on. At least with you could go, ""OK, this is garbage but I understand why this kind of ~I'm Important~ fantasy appeals to nerds."" With this book I have no fucking clue. What's the appeal here?

"this was the change in thinking Sci-fi can induce. i was all about space and mathematics while reading this book. not so much about video games like some of y'all although it has some of that. but had no one to talk to about it. i also really liked the Chinese cultural history of this and felt like i was one of their peoples. they mentioned westerns being monetarily induced and i literally found myself saying ""bastards"" which must have been good writing. i can only conclude that Liu Cixin is such a good writer that even non-Sci-fi are a fans of this work. the world building is great. The storytelling is great. there are so many great ideas a imaginative mind like mine can expand on! the other race was always in doomsday mode it reminded me of a show on history channel called Universe where it spent half the episodes going over what could destroy the earth! rambling again, this is a must read for any sci-fi fan. there is also a show i will watch! just can't wait till my audible credits come in to order the rest of the series!

"Прочетох ""Трите тела"" от Лиу Цъсин, което за мен е постижение, тъй като научната фантастика е на светлинни години разстояние от литературната ми зона на комфорт. Няма да коментирам романа, достойнствата му са признати и той е получил своите международни отличия, сред които и награда ""Хюго"". Но много ми се иска да ви кажа колко се възхищавам на превода от китайски, дело на Стефан Русинов! Той е блестящ! С много фин, изящен и педа��тичен размах Стефчо е разплел и изплел обратно на български сложна тъкан от физични процеси, математически теории и китайски реалии. Безкомпромисен превод, който наистина заслужава внимание.
А още по-интересното в случая е, че Стефчото си е направил подкаст, в който в продължение на 40+ минути разправя увлекателно всякакви щуротии свързани с появата и превода на ""Трите тела"" на български и е много приятно да го слушаш, най-вече докато си миеш чиниите или приготвяш ядене. 😉

But I actually really liked the book. The idea of very peculiar First Contact, the idea of (always) failing human kind, the Cultural Revolution stuff - it all connects into the very interesting puzzle picture in the end.
I saw many reviewers complaining that characters weren't too deep but I don't think this kind of story required it. What was there was already enough.
It's a very unique story (while in fact rather simple when you think about it), even though while reading it it reminded me of some other sci-fi works and authors (mostly Strugacki brothers came to my mind).
I'm definitely going to read the sequel. Just need a short break and some distance.

The issue with this book is the probably the same as dealing with any translated work. I don't love every translation of the Iliad and the nature of epic poetry isn't the most interesting to everyone. Same with the Witcher, which I think is far better in video game format.

The issue I had here is that the plot is so much more interesting than the way it's told. Every character--with the possible exception of Ye--is basically an NPC, even the protagonist. But there are some legitimately awesome plot elements and my interest in where it was going was enough to compel me forward.

The best parts for me were definitely the 3 Body game. 20 pages of sophon explanation and '11 dimensional space' is a bit much.

"Warning: Mild spoilers

This is the first SF novel that I am reading from a non-European author: and I am in two minds about it. While it follows the sub-genre I adore most - ""hard"" science fiction, meaning the emphasis is on real, serious science and its impact on human beings and not rhetorical, philosophical questions - at the end, this award-winner proved strangely unsatisfying. Let me try to analyse my reasons for it.



: It has got mind-bending science. The ""three-body problem"", from Newtonian mechanics, refers to ""the problem of taking the initial positions and velocities of three point masses and solving for their subsequent motion as dictated by Newton's laws of motion and of universal gravitation. The three-body problem is a special case of the n-body problem. Unlike two-body problems, there is no closed-form solution for all sets of initial conditions, and numerical methods are generally required."" (Wikipedia). To put it simply, when three celestial bodies orbit in space, each influenced by the other two, it is very difficult to derive equations to predict their motions from first principles - the motion is liable to become extremely unpredictable and chaotic. Now consider a world controlled by three suns like this!

This is just the main premise. The story is peppered throughout with scientific information - radio telescopes, nanotechnology, particle physics, quantum computing - the book is virtually a geek's delight (I was practically drooling over these passages!). And don't worry, it's not all technological jargon. Any layman with a bit of interest in science can understand and enjoy.

: The philosophical and social commentary is also pretty interesting. The mad years of Chairman Mao's insane cultural revolution and the untold harm it did to China's intellectual space is poignantly described (in fact, it is one of the factors which drives the plot along). The links between Buddhist meditation and higher physics are also interestingly described, without sliding into metaphysical gobbledygook.

: Characterisation is generally a casualty in hard SF, but here it's not. Ye Wenjie the astrophysicist, Wang Miao the nanomaterials researcher and Shi Qiang the arrogant yet brilliant policeman are very well drawn; the reader gets attached to them, starts caring about what happens to them; not only for the ideas they propound.



: The narrative style was a trifle weak. I don't know whether it is the problem with the translation or whether Chinese stories are usually narrated like this - but it was mostly all ""tell"" and not ""show"". While this helped in understanding the complex concepts easily, it read like exposition in many places, especially towards the end.

: The story felt rather hollow to me. It was as though the author wanted to discuss all these tremendous concepts and concocted a story to bung them all in. It felt like a curry where too many rich ingredients had been added and improperly mixed and cooked.

***

I loved this paragraph in the afterword by the author:
We know exactly what makes him write these stories! However, I feel that in expounding on the wonder of science, he forgot to pay enough attention to the ""fiction"" part of ""science fiction"".

Still, an enjoyable read for SF aficionados.

"I have been getting yelled at for a while to read ""The Three-Body Problem."" I really wish that I had left it alone. I had a hard time even getting immersed in the book cause not a lot of it made sense to me and we kept changing POVs. I know about the Cultural Revolution in China (East Asia was my main focus when I got my undergraduate degree in History) but linking that with science fiction didn't gel that well in my opinion. I can see though why some of the characters were over mankind though due to what they had been through in their lives, but I would still hard pause about some of the choices that we had people make throughout this book. The ending just left me nonplussed.

""The Three-Body Problem"" follows several characters, Ye Wenjie a disgraced scientist, Michael Evans, a rich man, and Wang Miao, a nanotechnology professor, and a whole host of people I am probably forgetting at this point. I am not going to lie, after a while I stopped taking in people's names. The book bounces back and forth the most between Ye and Wang though.

The book starts off during China's Cultural Revolution. Ye witnesses her father being murdered and is sent off to work in a labor camp after being labeled a traitor. While there though she is recruited by Red Coast (China's organization that is out there looking for proof of alien life). Due to Ye's expertise she is asked about working with radio communications to get messages back and forth from aliens. Eventually Ye does have first contact with people from the planet Trisolaris.

Fast forward to Wang in the present day who gets asked to work with a detective who is looking into the deaths of some scientists. Wang starts to notice some things that are weird and wonders if something more sinister is going on. Eventually though Wang is playing a virtual reality game called ""Three Body.""

I didn't feel a real connection to any of the characters while I was reading this. I tried, but I found myself getting bored for the most part. The only things that held my interest was when Wang went into the Three Body game and I found myself becoming fascinated with the game.

The writing got a bit convoluted to me when trying to explain the science behind everything.





The flow of the book was off and as I said, I struggled to finish this. I just found myself wishing for the book to finally get to the ending. When I did I was just relieved I managed to finish it.

"Ana’s Take:

During China’s Cultural Revolution, young astrophysicist Ye Wenjie watches her father be executed in the name of progress in front of her very eyes. This singular event will shape not only the rest of her life but also the future of mankind.

A few years after that she is co-opted to participate on a top secret governmental project that ostensibly studies satellites. The truth is something else (and out there).

Decades later, scientists start killing themselves.

In the near future, nanoscientist Wang Miao is asked – by a multinational military-police task force – to infiltrate a seemingly innocuous scientists club. He starts playing a virtual reality game named Three Body and becomes increasingly obsessed with it. The game follows the rise and fall of a civilization – let’s call it Trisolaris – over and over again as its players try to solve an abstract problem that has befuddled scientists for centuries: how to predict how three objects will orbit each other in a repeating pattern? The potential solution to that problem is essential to save the Trisolarians and to win the game.

And then the countdown starts.

Written by Cixin Liu and translated into English by Ken Liu, The Three-Body Problem is – and you have to forgive me the cliché – a tour-de-force. The story goes back and forth in time, following two main characters and bridging all the aforementioned disparate plotlines into a cohesive whole that blew my mind away.

Because The Three-Body Problem is exciting as it is thought-provoking. As a science nerd as well as a puzzle enthusiast, I gobbled this book up like it was a box of Lindt chocolates. It is not immediately obvious what exactly is at stake here, the revelations happening with every twist and turn, as the story progresses and as the connection between the different elements become clear – or every time Wang entered Three Body and played a round. The evolution of this story is phenomenal, especially how it connects history, hard science and sociology in a readable, engaging way.

Then we have the basic premise of the novel which is based on two principles: one, that first contact between civilizations doesn’t need to happen in actuality for things to change; and two, that an encounter with an alien race will not end well because why would it? Those two are the foundation on which the author has written this tome.

With the cat out of the bag – yes, this is a novel about aliens, or rather, about first contact – the question becomes what Will Happen Next, as humans find themselves in separate sides of this pending war: some welcoming our new overlords, others wanting to fight to the very end. Even those factions are not as evenly split as that, within each of those there are One of the most impacting things about The Three-Body Problem is how the utterly personal, how one small independent action by one person can impact the lives of so many. Ye Wenjie’s decisions are completely and absolutely understandable as they are completely and absolutely unforgivable. And every single one of her actions can be traced back to that opening moment in the novel.

If Ye Wenjie is a fantastic character, the same cannot (unfortunately) be said about the remaining characters. Wang Miao for example never becomes more than “eyes” – through him we see everything that is happening but he is never fleshed out enough to become an entity on his own.

It is possible to argue though that the main character of the novel is not one single person. Rather, the main character is Earth – or, humanity as a collective. That’s who or what we are to root for (or against, depending on where you stand when it comes to appreciating how much our planet is worth). That’s another fabulous side of The Three-Body Problem as it’s almost a choose-your-own-adventure: you can choose sides and play this game any way you want.

With all that said, the book does have a few structural problems. There is a lot of info-dump but I was happy to give those a pass given their fascinating content. The exposition though, was quite clumsy. At one point a major character says, literally in the middle of a stand-off, “let me tell you what happened in the past” and proceeds to tell another character What Happened Then.

Finally, there is the question of the added translator’s notes at end of each chapter rather than as footnotes or at the end of the novel. This might sound incredibly nit-picking but the placement of those notes at the end of each chapter was intrusive as it broke the flow of the story as one has to stop and read them – with such a placement it became a matter of having to read them rather than choosing to read them because it felt like one would inevitably miss a piece of VIP information if not reading them there and then.

But those are minor criticisms because The Three-Body Problem is easily one of the best books I read this year. I enthusiastically recommend it. The sequel cannot come soon enough.

Thea’s Take:

I confess that, initially, I was not particularly excited about The Three-Body Problem.

The book’s synopsis (and frankly, package) isn’t very grabbing, and although there were many glowing author blurbs attached to the title, the story sounded incredibly broad and hard to get excited about or truly fathom. But then trusted folks – mainly, dear Ana – told me to give it a try, that I would love it, etc.

I’m glad I listened. Let me put it this way: The Three-Body Problem is the best science fiction novel I’ve read in 2014. It might be the best novel I’ve read in 2014, period.

The story is thus: During the frenzied height of the Cultural Revolution, a university student watches as her professor father is murdered by the zealous Red Guard. Booted from her own physics research, Ye Wenjie is sent to a remote countryside observation station where she eventually begins her work anew, under the careful watch of the government.

Many years later, in the near future, prominent physicists are killing themselves – all are tied to an organization called Frontiers of Science. A scientist named Wang Miao is asked to join the club in order to get to the root of the deaths, when he stumbles across a virtual game called Three Body… and weird shit starts to go down.

I don’t want to spoil the particulars of The Three-Body Problem, because there are many different revelations that coalesce and crescendo throughout the text – these are best discovered and realized on one’s own. (In fact, I kind of hate that the book description reveals that the strange world of Three Body is actually a representation of alien world Trisolaris, and the extremes it faces with its tri-solar environment. But that’s just me.) What you need to know is this:

The Three-Body Problem is a book that is, like its namesake virtual game, rich with nuance and detail. It’s a story about first contact between humanity and an intelligent, doomed alien species in the strangest possible way; but more than that, it’s a human story about the flawed people who make decisions that ripple outward and change the course of time and history. This is a science fiction novel, but it’s also a story about the changing narrative of history, really – at one point in the book a story is told about an adult who explains to a child that the pictured people are not heroes or villains; they are history. On a much larger, metatextual level, this analogy holds true for Ye Wenjie, Yang Dong, Wang Miao, Captain Shi Qiang, and the whole assorted cast of the novel. This is a visionary look at history and the narratives that people impose and write over space and time.

The Three-Body Problem is told told from a Chinese perspective, set during and after the Cultural Revolution. As Ana says, Ye Wenjie is forever changed – her heart frozen over – after watching her father’s death at the hands of the Red Guard. This is an integral part of her growth and decisions as a character. Beyond Ye Wenjie, however, The Three-Body Problem shows the profound impact that the Cultural Revolution had on scientific accomplishment and progress, on social, economic and interpersonal relationships from the smallest particle, to the grandest extrasolar levels. Again, the roots of this story lie in history – specifically Chinese history, but also on a grander scale of interaction and reaction of beings (and unstable bodies) that circle and coincide with each other.

The Three-Body Problem is a hard science fiction novel, rife with exposition. This has the potential to be very good, or very bad. You do not need to be a physicist to read or enjoy this book, but if you do not like science, math, puzzles, or lengthy discussion about such things, you might not be as fond of this book as Ana or I. As for me? I loved the lessons in transmission of energy and broadcasting signals, the chaos and possible stability of three suns, the potential applications of nanotechnology and interstellar possibilities. Oh, I should also say The Three-Body Problem is a weird book – from the first time you enter Three Body, read the chants of de-hy-drate and meet the various philosophers, scientists, and emperors who make their own cameos, you’ll see just how weird the book can be. But it’s a beautiful, enchanting, dreamlike weird. And I mean that in the best way – it’s been a while since I’ve been fully blown away by true originality in SFF (that sounds so jaded, but it’s true). The Three-Body Problem is wonderfully, memorably different. And I loved that.

The Three-Body Problem has some issues with clunkiness. I’m not sure if that is translation or syntax, or if it’s just a poor editorial choice to include footnotes throughout the text in the manner of an academic paper. I like that there are notes from excellent translator Ken Liu throughout the book; I am less enamored with the fact that these are represented as footnotes that interrupt the flow of reading. I agree that had these comments come in the form of end-of-chapter notes (see Losers in Space by John Barnes, for instance), the reading experience of The Three-Body Problem would have been improved.

That said…the book is so damn awesome, I really cannot find other fault.

For me, it’s a Top 10 book of the year – and I absolutely, wholeheartedly, enthusiastically recommend it to all.

"Full of wild ideas and a fascinating conceptual idea of evolution in an environment inhospitable to live. If you read for big scientific ideas, you might dig it. If you read mostly for story, however, like me, you might not. This book reminded me of why I stopped reading Big Idea scifi in my teens. Characters are there just to provide a context to explain the author's scientific concepts. They are thin and unrealistic. The plot serves the same purpose, setting up a contrived, convoluted setting so the thin characters can dump endless amounts of exposition along the lines of, ""As we all know ... "" or ""In this paper I read by Famous Scientist, quantum entanglement means ... "".

I'm guessing many of the story issues I had are a result of things lost in translation (this book was apparently a major seller in China). Much of the science was over my head, and much more was just .

The first half of the book is a real slog. It's so full of endless exposition that I almost put it down. The virtual reality video game concept that takes up the majority of the book [spoiler] turns out to have no solution. The character is, supposedly, trying to solve the ""three-body problem,"" and it turns out that there solution, because the author tells you that at the end of the game. Which means that the hundreds of pages dedicated to the game largely have zero impact on the story. When I found that out, I longed to get my hours of reading back[/spoiler]. I think there's also something to be said for the fact that this book was written in 2006, when the concept of a fully immersive VR game was still somewhat novel (although largely pioneered that concept in 1992), the idea of a VR world as the primary plot device seems a little trite by the time THREE-BODY was translated to English in 2014.

The second half of the book picks up a little bit, driven by an antagonist group whose motivations seem kind of far-fetched. To me, anyway. To the ""humanity is awful and should be destroyed"" and ""all big business is bad, hmmm-kay?"" crowd, I'm sure it hit the sweet spot.

This book was originally written in 2006. It won the Hugo in 2015, proving one thing for certain: I am absolutely ignorant as to what makes an ""award winning"" science fiction novel.

I listened to the audiobook. The narrator was great. And despite the issues of this book going against my particular tastes in storytelling, I did finish it. Luckily, I was really delighted by the last 10 pages or so, which put a smiley-face period at the end of a run-on sentence.

"Yes, the entire history of humankind has been fortunate. From the Stone Age till now, no real crisis has occurred. We’ve been very lucky. But if it’s all luck, then it has to end one day. Let me tell you: It’s ended. Prepare for the worst.

This book first appeared on my radar after receiving good reviews from quite a few people I know. It is originally written in Chinese, but is being translated to English. While a few of the metaphors were slightly awkward, I felt the translation held up pretty well. There are a few cultural differences that the author does a great job of explaining in footnotes. Not being from China my knowledge of the Cultural Revolution was limited, but I didn't feel too lost.

The messages are true no matter where you are from.



The book is quite heavy scientifically, so if you don't have an interest in science I suggest you skip it. It is based around the three-body problem (obviously) that has existed in physics for some time. Given a initial starting mass, position and velocity of three objects is it possible to determine the motion of these three objects. There is a lot of physics theories referenced as well as long descriptions of the problem which may bore some readers.



However, I found the premise interesting and am curious to see where the author goes with this series.

I've seen some people defending the book saying it is a novel of ideas, which I guess it is (although I don't find all the ideas that interesting), but did it have to be so written?

The characters are practically non-existant, the plot is oddly/badly paced. Characters hardly react to the curious things happening (although I have wondered if this is a cultural thing..?), do all sorts of stuff that feels wholly unmotivated.

There's a scene where a couple of baddies say they're supposedly holding bombs in bags, and there then follows a scene where the goodies shove a set of small electronic scales to the baddies, so they can demonstrate how much the bags weigh to prove the bombs are in there AND WHY IS THIS EVEN HAPPENING

Our main character one day wakes up with a numerical counter in front of his eyes, running down. He figures out how to remove it from his vision, and then never mentions it again. It's such straaange human behaviour. And variations of it keep happening.

I'm still not actually sure the main character was the main character. Or even a character.

"Al final he ido de más a menos con el libro. Sensación agridulce y bastante decepcionado.

No he leído demasiada ciencia ficción, la verdad. Y es algo que poco a poco voy remediando. No obstante, para mí, ""El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos"", del multipremiado y aclamado ""Liu Cixin"" está lejísimos, a eones, de ser una obra maestra. Esa categoría la reservo para obras magnas como ""Dune"" o ""Hyperion"", que si me lo parecen, aunque quizá porque atesoran elementos más cercanos a la fantasía, y con los que estoy infinitamente más familiarizado.

En general me ha parecido una historia plana, insulsa y terriblemente simple. Tiene, todo hay que decirlo, 3 o 4 ideas potentes, así como unos cuantos conceptos fascinantes, especulativos, con sentido de la maravilla, algo que se le exige a la ciencia ficción.

El problema, al fin y al cabo, es que los personajes son inexistentes, ni uno memorable, y los pocos que prometen tienen escasa relevancia, casi testimonial; las partes de ""ciencia pura/dura"" (que entiendo que otros lectores las disfruten e, incluso, las demanden) me sacaban de la historia y me suscitaban nulo interés, y claro, a ello súmale que, en realidad, toda la parafernalia encubre una manida y previsible invasión alienígena con su consabida y manoseada destrucción de la raza humana aderezada con un poco de quintaculumnismo, misantropía, realidad virtual y ecologismo extremista. La premisa y los ingredientes gustan, tienen gancho, pero la ejecución frustra lo que promete, se queda a mitad del camino.

No es una catástrofe, pero tampoco me anima a seguir con la saga. Veremos.

"In his Afterword for the American edition, Liu Cixin says ""The stories of science are far more magnificent , grand, involved, profound, thrilling, strange, terrifying, mysterious, and even emotional, compared to the stories told by literature. Only, these wonderful stories are locked in cold equations that most do not know how to read"", which whilst a stirring call to arms for writing about science (and, by extension, science fiction), begs the question how on Earth has he managed to write such a flat, uninspiring book? As other people have said, the characters are wooden, their motivations bizarre, and when we get to the big reveal of the ""bad guys"" (the Trisolarans), they are shown to be of such moustache-twirling villiany (with a line in adolescent abuse that's almost embarrassing) you half expect Flash Gordon to turn up at any minute. Of all the characters, Ye Wenjie and her reaction as a scientist to the Cultural Revolution is the most compelling and interesting, but outside of that, most of the other characters are mere ciphers designed to deliver the scientifically interesting, yet narratively abstruse exposition.

There are loads of good ideas in this book about the nature of science and progress, but simply throwing fact after fact about quantum mechanics at the page in the vain hope the reader will be impressed isn't the way to get them across. Overall, I'm afraid to say I didn't enjoy the book, and won't be reading the rest of the trilogy.

"I've had my eye on this trilogy of books for a while now and am glad to have started on it. I saw mixed reviews from my friends who've already read it, but the majority seemed positive. I'm also in the camp with those who enjoyed.

It is a fascinating science fiction story for multiple reasons. First, it is told from the perspective of multiple characters in China, referencing Chinese beliefs and history that I am just not that familiar. This created a different flavor to the conflict. Second, the story itself is a pretty unique idea, and one I found very interesting. I like plausible scenarios in science fiction, and I felt this was. Finally, I enjoyed the science. I like trying to piece ideas together, and this book gave me lots of pieces to play with.

As many other reviewers have said, characters are not the strongest aspect of this book. They are interesting enough, but their depth can be a little lacking. I can see why this bothered some, but in the long run, I didn't seem to mind that. The book probably would have been too long if more character building were to be added, and I'm not sure that would have added anything to it (at least for me).

Overall, this was well worth the read, and it has definitely sparked my curiosity in the big picture ideas presented. I'm excited to read the next book as I've heard it gets even better. I'm going to 4.0/5.0 for my rating.

"Reto lector 2024 PopSugar Reading Challenge 22. Un libro que se centre o trate de videojuegos

La verdad que la aparición del videojuego en la historia me dejó muy desorientada, dado cómo venía siendo la trama. Cuanto más aparecía el juego, más 😳 quedaba yo (me encantaba y resultaba muy entretenido, pero no entendía qué tenía que ver con nada)... hasta que la cosa se explica.
Me acabó resultando una novela estupenda, a pesar de que sus mejores partes he tenido que leerlas con una lentitud como si estuviera aprendiendo a leer (La m con la a ma. La p con la a pa. ¡Mapa!) para enterarme de algo. Así todo encuentro que la parte del videjuego y la de las explicaciones científicas...ah! Y lo del sofón (qué maravilla!), fueron las que más disfruté, junto con la que liaron con el barco ¡Madre mía!... bueno, al final son unas cuántas partes.
En cuanto al tema de los personajes: ni entro. No todas las comidas se hacen con todos los ingredientes y en la misma proporción. Depende de lo que se busque.
Eso sí, encuentro que la relación esfuerzo-recompensa está algo descompensada.

"Ok, so, I’ve heard lots of great things about this book and it has won a Hugo award and everything, which is huge. Now here’s me giving it a three star. Ok, before everyone comes and attacks me, a three star is not a bad rating, it means I liked it, but I also had some problems with it. So yes, overall, I liked it a lot, but in some respects, I also found it to be lacking. I have heard that books 2 and 3 are much better, just after looking at some reviews and I am continuing on with the series.

What I really found interesting was the whole concept. The game, Three-Body was really interesting. However, I also found that the book failed to have a proper plot structure in terms of executing it and the constant jumping back in forth in time and across star systems made it slightly disorienting, especially at how random these things occurred. Additionally, I could not connect with these characters at all and I felt that too much of the novel was focussed on the ideas aspect, which was amazing, but I have found that I really need engaging characters as well as an great concept for me to be truly engaged in a book.

There didn’t feel to be any real plot and most of it stays pretty mysterious as to what is going on with the world and I liked that aspect as how things were hidden towards the end. However, because of this, it also lacked direction and the reveal came incredibly late in the book that the first 60% or so didn’t feel like it had a purpose. Like I said, I found the Three-Body game to be interesting and unique, but we spend an awfully long amount of time in there without an apparent reason and it slowly became repetitive. I felt like at times that the author showed too much and that it instead could have been spent on building a connection between the reader and the characters.

Now, on these characters, simply, there wasn’t any time really spent on them and most of them really came across as flat with very little personality. Even though there is considerable time building up Ye Wenjie’s backstory, which was fine, we got to learn her history and why she is and who she is in the present, there’s not whole lot of personality and the narration style is really distant. Wang Miao, who is essentially the main character, is really a blank slate. There’s nothing to makes him unique as a character and its annoying because the concept is dope. I don’t know if it is the translation that makes it so that the characters are this way and that if it is different in Chinese. The one character who actually did have a personality and was interesting to read as a character was Shi Qiang but he also does occasionally come off as annoying.

There’s lots of scientific terms and discussions in here which, for my pea sized brain was pretty confusing. It does make it feel far more believable though and in explaining at how things might be, and I liked that. It’s also frustrating in a novel when it doesn’t fully explain things, or make things seem believable, but this book was able to achieve all that which was great.

While there were lots of interesting and cool things going on, nothing about it really made me feel excited or energised to keep the turning the page. I suppose in a sense that there’s no real payoff and that while the ending feels final enough, there was also no lead up and it was just like, yup I’ve explained everything, and the book is over. In that sense, it does feel that this book is a set up book where its purpose is to explain the world and what is going on and gives the reader all the information it needs for the rest of the trilogy. I say this as much of this book is giving the backstory to everything that’s going on and explaining things and introducing the reader to all the different ideas and building up the world which it does an amazing job of.

Overall, I definitely enjoyed it and I ended up really liking the concept, but I did wish for much stronger characters and a more coherent plot. I ultimately don’t know what was lost in the translation unfortunately so I don’t know what that would have changed. 6.5/10

"This is a special book. It started slow for about the first third, then in the middle third it started to get interesting, then the last third blew my mind. This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go.

It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I've read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being ""reactionaries"", etc.

It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell.

"La historia se divide en tres tramas y géneros diferentes. Por un lado, la novela histórica, narrándonos ciertos hechos acaecidos durante la Revolución Cultural china, donde conoceremos a Ye Wenjie, una joven astrofísica que asistirá a la tortura y muerte de su padre por sus ideas científicas. Además de marcarla de por vida, también acabará siendo sospechosa política. Por otro lado, y años después, tenemos la novela de misterio, donde Wang Miao, experto en nanomateriales, será requerido por el gobierno chino para ayudar en el esclarecimiento de los diversos suicidios de científicos famosos que se están sucediendo por el mundo. Por último, también tenemos el género de ciencia ficción, en el juego de realidad virtual , donde se explora la evolución de un mundo con tres soles de diferente masa. Y mejor no contar nada más.

‘El problema de los tres cuerpos’ (2007), del chino Cixin Liu, es una magnífica novela de ciencia ficción , donde se especula sobre astronomía, física, política, medio ambiente y metafísica. Hay ciertas partes un tanto lentas, sobre todo durante el juego virtual, pero que siguen siendo interesantes e importantes para el desarrollo de la historia. He leído comentarios respecto a la poca profundidad de los personajes, pero a mí me han parecido correctos, y noto su evolución a lo largo del libro. Quizá no son igual de intensos que en otras obras y autores, pero podría ser porque es una novela escrita por un asiático con protagonistas asiáticos. Lo que está claro, es que al término de la novela recuerdas a los personajes, algo que no sucedería si fuesen meros elementos para el avance de la historia.

"Just because I'm now watching the Netflix show, I think I need to re-read this :)

actual rating is 4.5

I describe this book as one of the best real Sci-Fi books written in recent years. Lui Cixin is a true genius with a deep sight in both sociology and science (more specifically physics).The book is the first book in a three books trilogy which was very successful in China and now we have first and second book translated into English.

Cixin uses the unique communism atmosphere of China and the days that everything was hugely controlled by the government. He even creates a similar alien world that is kind of like a conservative communist country.

I am a huge fan of Asimov books (mainly because you could see science in his books) and Cixin is the same. You enjoy reading about revolution in China and events that lead characters to loose their hope in human society and betray the humanity and at the same time you read quantum physics and learn about possible new ideas.

It was a very enjoyable read for me and the only thing preventing me from giving it a full 5 was that after I passed the half, I kind of felt that it's a little too slow.

"Chinese Sci-Fi and the Historical Materialism of… Aliens?

Preamble:
--As predominantly a non-fiction reader, my top priority for reading fiction is how many fruitful thought-experiments are conjured during my reading and afterwards when I reflect on my notes. Bonus points here for the vantage point of this novel (first serialized in 2006) being popular in China first, before being translated to English in 2014.
…On the fiction side, the story-telling flowed well where even readers of Dan-Brown-escapist-entertainment can get hooked.
--This first-in-a-trilogy checks off all the boxes, placing it next to in my recent adult fiction successes.

:

1) :
--It’s curious reading such a popular modern Chinese literature centering the censored Chinese Cultural Revolution. This event is not just the intro’s setting; it seems etched in the wrinkles and contradictions of Chinese social imaginations presented by the author (Liu). Liu seems to portray a legacy of political despair/weariness, resulting in a depoliticized gravitation towards and (fear of chaos). I’m reminded of several to-reads:
-
-
--I use “seems” deliberately, once more reminded of the limitations of using novels to analyse the big picture of complex processes, which novelist Ghosh critiques in . Liu’s direct descriptions of the Cultural Revolution revolve around a stereotypical “struggle session”, as this offers the most vivid . This perpetuates a bias obscuring fascinating structural analysis: what happened (big picture structures)? How does this fit with various Chinese depictions? Western depictions?

--Thus, we must turn to nonfiction. Thankfully, critical-yet-accessible nonfiction analysis are on the rise; see 1Dime’s videos:
i)
ii)
…these videos introduce and synthesize several books, including:
i) : rather than crude Western propaganda blaming Mao’s totalitarian control, Mao actually turned to decentralization: promoting the Red Guard (public, esp. students) to critique the Party’s revisionists.
…This promotion for the public to critique the Party (i.e. rather than reconstructive “pluralization”…an internal contradiction that led to the Red Guard’s implosion; a real lesson for the Left!) unleashed an , as the prevalence of vague slogans of critique turned into vulgar, depoliticized (i.e. personal feuds) identity politics (actual “cancel culture”).
…Now, before we go back to blaming Mao/leftists, the author stresses that the Party’s conservatives actually fanned the identity politics hysteria (the Right is always relying on weaponizing identity politics after all, i.e. ); since they were Mao’s original targets, they promoted distractions via vulgar identity politics like targeting descendants of suspect classes… teachers/intellectuals/artists were also convenient targets.
…Note: we should synthesize the weaponization of identity politics with videos by as well as its scholarly references on in/out groups:

ii) : despite the turmoil of “revolution from below” and all the depictions of its excesses (ex. “struggle sessions”), the actually caused the most casualties but is brushed over (this is the norm in top-down depictions of history, with another infamous example being the French Revolution’s “Reign of Terror”: )
iii) : further details how “revolution from above” triggered “revolution from below”.
iv) : different experiences between , uncovering rural improvements (also typically brushed over in history).

"I admit I flipped through the first few pages at the bookstore and noped it right back on the shelf. I've little knowledge of the Cultural Revolution and it seemed a far cry from the expansive sci-fi promised on the cover. But Ye Wenjie witnessing the death of her father in these opening chapters informs her motivations going forward as she becomes an astrophysicist who makes first contact.

I've never really examined my pollyanna notions of first contact, informed by Zefram Cochrane and his contact with the Vulcans in Star Trek lore. Rationally it would be more akin to colonizers landing in the new world spreading small pox, religious indoctrination and mass genocide - Earth, just another world ripe for plunder. And of course there would some among us hungry for this alien annihilation believing it a punishment we so rightly deserve.

And then there's the alien Trisolarans who, understanding that an invasion will take 400 years, can admit that our current explosive technological progress might quickly outpace their alien knowledge in the ensuring centuries. That something must be done. That they must kill our science.

I'm giddy with the slow burn of first contact and the ideas explored here. This is hard-sci-fi that still manages to be absolutely wild with a wonderful translation by Ken Liu.

"I had heard mixed reviews about this one. As it is a Chinese book translated, I had heard that perhaps some of the translation didn't come across properly, and I heard a lot about the lack of character development.

All I can say is that I wouldn't have even noticed if I didn't read those reviews! The book didn't NEED any character development because the plot was so thick with craziness, science and freakingly intelligent aliens!

I don't even know where to begin with my review for this one to be honest. It was quite dense even for a sci-fi nerd like me.

I think one of the things that really appealed to me about this book was that it seemed to be written from a different lens than I am used to reading. I'm going to try to explain what I mean. I generally read American/English/Australian authors and I guess the books I read all have that capitalist culture lens view. I have never read a book that has been translated from Chinese before and as I was picturing the story in my head, it had this totally different feel to it. Things made sense but didn't quite make sense. The relationships and the way people were treated or viewed were similar, but not. All of it had a surreal quality that I am not sure if it is the cultural difference, the translation or just the writer. But I was hooked!

I did a mix of the audio and written version which was a good idea at the start while I was getting into the writing style and story. And there were numerous parts that I read a few times just to be sure of what I thought I just read...

I'm not going to lie I found it an effort. But well worth it.

The intricate plot I am not going to go into too much detail about here. And I would advise you not to look at too many reviews while you make up your mind if you are going to read it. Basically, a scientist sends out a beacon to another planet. And it is answered. The trisolarins are an alien race living on a hostile world with three suns continuously causing unpredicted turmoil on the planet (googling the physics theory of the three body problem for dummies helped me wrap my head around this one). They need a new world. What happens when they find out about ours?

I found it difficult to get into at first but it did absolutely improve. So don't be discouraged if it doesn't click with you immediately. The science is DENSE but not to a point where you can't enjoy the book if you don't quite understand the science behind it.

I just found the whole thing mind-blowing. I can see why the hype has exploded.
The concepts and themes were something special and certain things happened in the plot that just made me stop and go ""WHAT THE HELL"" - in a good way!

Yet I am reluctant to give it 5 stars. Probably due to the denseness and the fact that the plot can be quite slow at times. However completely worth the effort! Glad it is a series and there is more in this story to explore

"Nota: 4,25 ⭐

Segundo intento, libro acabado y lectura muy satisfactoria.
Hace ya un buen puñado de años tuve esta novela en mis manos y se me hizo muy espesa, por el motivo que fuese -ahora no recuerdo- en ningún momento conecté con ella. En cambio ahora ha tenido toda mi atención y he disfrutado mucho de su lectura.
Vuelvo a repetir la importancia de coger un libro en el momento adecuado. Esto me anima a la relectura de otros libros que nunca llegamos a ser amigos.

Nos encontramos con una novela de ciencia ficción dura, pero por suerte no es su totalidad ni tampoco en gran proporción. De hecho la sensación que he tenido sobre todo ha sido de misterio y suspense.






Cixin Liu en su versión más nos cuenta desde varios puntos de vista y desde varias épocas unos hechos -que es imposible comentar sin hacer spoiler- que como comenté mas arriba han tenido toda mi atención, capítulos que devoras queriendo saber más y por si fuera poco, unas pequeñas clases de historia sobre la revolución cultural en China de los años 60.

Pero también tenemos al Cixin Liu . Entiendo que estas partes son las que a mucha gente les haya echado para atrás. Hay un capítulo, que si uno padece de migrañas y/o cefaleas es posible que acabe el día con fuertes dolores. En mi caso he podido capear el temporal y salir airoso, pero he de reconocer que son partes muy densas.






En resumen, una novela que me ha gustado mucho, que no recomiendo porque no es lectura para todo el mundo y que por supuesto seguiré con las continuaciones, que estas según me han chivado son incluso mejores.

"Creo que su puntuación ideal hubieran sido 4.5 estrellas, pero creo que también se merece las 5.

Esta es una lecturas cuyo hype no ha conseguido alzarse por encima de la calidad de la obra y eso ya es algo a tener en cuenta.

No os voy a hablar mucho de la historia porque a esta novela hay que llegar virgen, sí como al matrimonio XD.

Lo que puedo adelantaros es que esta repleta de secretos e incertidumbre durante gran parte de ella, lo que al menos en mí caso ha conseguido que me pasara media lectura teorizando sobre hacia donde podía todo transcurrir.

Tanto el ritmo de la narración como la prosa empleada, me han parecido perfectas para una lectura de este estilo. Algunos dirán que es algo simple, yo digo que viva la prosa directa y basta ya de parrafadas que solo aburren a las ovejas.

Por ponerle algunos peros, los personajes son algo planos, aunque en este caso creo que es algo premeditado para darle más importancia a la historia y lo que si me ha parecido su gran pero, al final de la trama, se nos ofrece cierta información, pero de una forma abrupta y poco natural que creo se podría haber narrado de otra manera.

Pronto, una civilización alienígena al borde de la destrucción capta la señal y comienza a planear su desembarco en la Tierra. Durante las décadas siguientes, se comunica a través de un insólito método: un extraño videojuego virtual impregnado de historia y filosofía. Pero a medida que los alienígenas empiezan a ganar a los jugadores terrícolas, se forman distintos bandos, unos dispuestos a dar la bienvenida a esos seres superiores y ayudarlos a hacerse cargo de un mundo tan corrupto, y otros preparados para luchar contra la invasión. El resultado es una experiencia tan auténtica como reveladora sobre nuestro tiempo.

"After a good night's sleep, I think I am able to sort my thoughts on this book so here we go.

Earth, China, 1969, during the Cultural Revolution. Scientists are rounded up, killed, tortured, or at least questioned - as are their families. What does this have to do with human technological advancement and contact with an alien species over the next decades and even centuries? Absolutely everything as torture can break a human. And it did. One very specific human was so broken, in fact, that they set in motion the events in this book, thereby laying the groundwork for the rest of the trilogy. Seemingly small events triggering huge ones, maybe even the end of humanity. I liked how the author nicely established that every little bit is important even if we might not be able to discern that in any given moment.
(Though it was equally nice
, which is of course commentary on some regimes on this planet. Ahem.)

I can't give away much more about the contents of this book without spoilers but there are things we can and indeed need to talk about a bit more. Such as human nature. At first, many developments in this book seem ... alien, for the lack of a better word. But it actually is all done by humans. It's just that so many are naive, idiotic, downright fanatic. Sure, I understand some of the frustration and desperation but selling out the entire planet? Come on! I was therefore not at all surprised about the emergence of the ETO and its development.
It was endlessly fascinating how the author made it all happen with barely any interference by the Trisolarans at all! We ARE our own worst enemy, I guess. And as low-tech as we might be, turning that tech against us is soooo easy (we make it easy for certain elements). When combining that with stunting the development of better tech simultaneously, that's a potent weapon. No need for huge space battles.
(The look at Trisolaris and its civilisation was a welcome switch of POV, however, and it gave further insight thereby creating a nice sort of anticipation for the next books(s).)

What definitely also has to be mentioned is how erudite the author is - and not just philosophically. While reading, I could not only feel how enthusiastic the author is about science but how much he actually knows. Knowledge that must have been there at least in part before he began writing this book. So I googled him. He's an engineer. Yep, fits. I work with weirdos like him. *chuckles* However, he has the uncanny ability to combine his own knowledge and enthusiasm with a seriously underrated story that sneaks up on you only to bash you over the head with one revelation after another.

As happens often with books that are styled like a mystery, I worked out core points relatively early on. However, whenever we finally found out HOW something came about, it nevertheless came as a shock. Pulling that off is extremely difficult, not many authors manage that.

Regarding the characters, let me warn you right away: you might not like or root for anyone. The feeling I got while reading this was that of a distant look at things. This might serve the rest of the trilogy well. In fact, I bet it does and was a deliberate stylistic choice. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean you won't get sucked into the story or get excited / worried while reading. It's a bit like reading a history book: the events are already over but reading detailed accounts can still give you the heebie-jeebies.

So yes, I can definitely see why this has won a HUGO because it is choke-full of (accurate) science and mindblowing worldbuilding. Can't wait to see where the author takes us next.

This book needs patience because it's an intelligent kind of read.
The past, the present and the future entwine in such a way that, at some point, you won't be able to figure out if it's historical fiction, dystopia or just really smart science fiction. It does indeed need patience to get through, especially if you are like me and can't grasp the concept of physics, but even with the that and the complex mathematics, you'll still get such an inventive story that will simply make you want to find out more, page by page.
It's definitely one of the finest works of sci-fi I've read so far.

"This was one of the strangest books I've read in a while. It was also pretty technical in many ways, and might not be understood by many non-technical readers. Even the name refers to a mathematical problem trying to predict the orbits of 3 bodies orbiting around each other, where each one is affected by two others. Apparently, there is a world that has two suns, and they cannot predict what is going to happen with their suns day by day. Unfortunately, on the days when both suns are up together, their world becomes pretty much uninhabitable, and most of them dehydrate into a flat body that can be rolled up. But they can rehydrate later when the planet becomes more hospitable. But they don't know how long it will stay in either state.

The characters in the book are mostly Chinese scientists. It starts out with the cultural revolution in the 60s when many of these scientists were either killed or sent away to the countryside, because Mao thought they were not important. So, there is a lot going on in the book.

I found it hard going at times, and confusing most of the time, but near the end of this (the first book), it started getting more interesting - enough that I've continued with the second book of the trilogy.

"This was a great example of a good concept executed badly. The first 20 pages or so read like a badly translated Chinese propaganda piece. After that it branches out into discussions of physics, higher math, and meetings where people talk a lot. We also see a character playing a game that combines the worst elements of both the Civ games and Second Life.

It's amazing that a book that has elements of both first contact and alien invasion can be boring, but it is. It doesn't help that most of the characters seem to have virtually no emotional life whatever, and much of the actual action takes place ""off screen."" Also, a lot of major events happen in the past and get either alluded to or flashbacked.

"It's actually probably two stars as I skimmed the last 50 pages, but I have respect for a great translation and interwoven stories. This isn't a book so much as a sparsely sourced thesis on the effects of wacky physics problems all happening at once, with a few mournful reflections on the Chinese Cultural Revolution and environmentalism in the margins.

: (no actual spoilers, just a list of topics)




-. This is an ideas book and there are some great ones. I can't tell you anything about them, but the effects of these physics problems on ""real world"" situations was very cool.

-. I found the bits about living in China during the Cultural Revolution to be heartbreaking and fascinating.

-. Overall a great job. Some of these translated works feel extremely stilted, but this one had great atmosphere and prose that could be quite evocative.

-. A lot of dystopic books don't sell me on the motivations for people to act against their self interest. This one really nailed it with a couple of well-chosen examples.

:

-. OMG. Soooo many infoduuuumps. And so many REPEATED info dumps. Whole chapters would be like ""remember that detail? Here's a lesson on the physics that make that small detail possible and cool. Isn't it cool? Let me tell you how cool I think it is.""

-. It really could have been condensed and become a much more taut piece.

-. Others have said it, but aside from Ye Wenjie, no one else matters, really. I hated how Wang treated his family. The council meetings were torturous to read. Da Shi was kinda cool because of how sharp he was but also really obnoxious.

-. A lot of the story requires a culture like ours and a deep understanding of Earth's efforts. It seems ludicrous to me to have a culture like the one we've been shown and find that actually they totally get our small squabbles and weird hobbies. That really ruined my suspension of disbelief.

-. Instead of ""it's aliens"" they say ""it's high energy particles."" Oh, well okay then. If it's particles sure, this all makes sense.

Interesting, but too long with very little to sink your teeth into. Great if you wanna see real physics do neat stuff, but not my favorite way to ingest science lectures. I would need an extremely compelling reason to continue the series.

"En plena revolucion ""cultural"" China socialista instalo un programa secreto de lo mas extraño, una antena parabolica con señales de microondas. Un proyecto tan secreto que no se le permitia el acceso a nadie mas que el personal previamente certificado como ""de confianza"". Pero no todos los que entraban en esa base secreta estaban por su voluntad, Ye Wenjei, era una ""prisionera"" dentro de la base, pero sus conocimientos en Astrofisica, la convertian en una necesidad para la base.
Años despues, cuando la base de ""Costa Roja"" cerro, Wenjei dedico su vida a dar clases y a criar a su unica hija, Yang Dong. Asi que cuando su hija muere, no espera que el gobierno investigue, y mucho menos que envien a un cientifico, Wang Miao.
Asi pues, Wang Miao se comienza a introducir en el mundo de Wenjei y descubre el mundo de los ""Tres Soles"", todo los problemas que estos se enfrentan. Pero las cosas no son lo que parecen, y el secreto de Wenjei pronto se descubrira y traera al planeta muchos mas problemas de los que enfrenta ahora.

Este es un libro dificil de resumir, tiene de todo, unos personajes interesantes, una linea de historia que atrapa y una trama inesperada pero bien llevada. Sinceramente no esperaba mucho de este libro, con todo y que me lo habian recomendado muchisimo, ya que no soy muy aficionada a leer ciencia ficcion, pero realmente valio la pena la lectura, solo para imaginar un futuro como el que plantea el autor.
Sin embargo, no me gusto como al final describen al mundo tri-solar, como cuentan su historia, casi como una copia de la historia de Wenjei al principio, cuando lei esa parte, casi podia decir que estaban describiendo el inicio del juego, que era la historia de fondo para que los jugadores conocieran el ""nuevo mundo"" (asi como los juegos de roles actuales). Asi que cuando el autor le dio emociones tan ""humanas"" a estos seres tri-solares, lo senti burdo, comun, sobre todo despues de como venia la trama haciendonos sentir que estos seres eran realmente superiores y poderosos, al final los pinta como unos seres humanos reconcorosos que solo quieren invadir una zona con mejores recursos que los suyos.
En fin, es una buena lectura, diferente, entretenida, que nos muestra el daño que constantemente le hacemos a nuestro planeta, y que nos plantea una solucion bastante drastica. Vale la pena leerla, pero no creo que siga con la serie, me gusto como termino esta, con la duda. Y es seguro que leere otros libros de este autor mas adelante.

""Човешкото невежество недостатък ли е или предимство от гледна точка на еволюцията? Много същества притежават вродени знания, които се проявяват под формата на инстинктивни действия.

По същия нячин природата би могла да предостави на вродено знание и на човечеството, включително такова и за законите на Вселената. И щом не го е направила, сигурно си има причина за това. Ако някога се разкрие и последната тайна на природата, ще може ли човечеството да продължи да съществува? Самоувереният утвърдителен отговор би бил повърхностен, тъй като никой не би могъл да си представи каква ще е тази тайна.""

"I liked parts of this book, but the whole thing didn't enthrall me. I'm so glad to be finished.

I think the translation is fine; the writing style is fine. The characters were very undeveloped, so there was no emotional connection to them. That made it feel like reading a textbook. The jumping around of time periods also felt disjointed. It was designed to maximize the mystery and suspense, but it was still jarring. Key events were told after they happened, which robbed the events of a ""here-and-now"" urgency.

I did like the physics stuff -- the three-body gravity problem and the signal transmissions and the dimensional quantum stuff was interesting to me. The virtual reality game was just weird. I didn't see why people would want to play it, though I understand the point was to weed out the non-serious science types.

The ending was very abrupt. It just stopped. Even typical cliffhangers leave you with something that was resolved. Not here.

Finally, I like to have a little comic relief in my books. Even cracked me up occasionally. There wasn't one teensy-weensy funny one-liner here.

"Un buen libro de ciencia ficción.

Me animé a leer este libro porque me lo recomendaron. Me aconsejaron que era mejor no saber nada del libro antes de leerlo, para disfrutarlo mejor; pero creo que era porque si me decían de que se trataba, el spoiler quitaría toda la intriga. Yo no haré spoilers porque no me gusta hacerlos, pero si mencionaré que esta obra, efectivamente, tiene muy buena ciencia ficción para disfrutar. Al principio me preocupe por la terminología científica que contenía la historia, y pensé que no iba a entender nada más adelante, pero me equivoque sobre eso porque es fácil seguir el hilo de la historia y comprender la idea general del libro.

El libro en general me pareció interesante, aunque tiene detalles que me gustaron y otros que no. Como no es ni completamente bueno ni tampoco malo, mi calificación es de solo tres estrellas.

Lo que no me gusto fueron los personajes, porque los sentí muy monótonos. Nunca sentí simpatía, preocupación o intriga por conocer el destino de los protagonistas, porque parecían simplemente máquinas que hablaban todo el tiempo de ciencia, y por más que el libro sea sobre ciencia, su jerga si me irrito por momentos. Otro detalle que no me gusto, fue que aproximadamente como desde la página 120 todo fue muy predecible, por lo que sentí una gran lentitud en el desarrollo de algunos capítulos del intermedio.

Lo que me gusto fue la ciencia ficción, porque está muy bien trabajada por parte de Liu Cixin; es lógica, interesante, muy creativa y no tengo quejas respecto a eso. También me gustó mucho el inicio y el desenlace. El inicio, porque me estimuló a investigar sobre la historia de China y quedó bien representada; el desenlace porque fue correcto, muy bien expuesto y nos deja sin dudas respecto a sucesos que se presentaban sin explicación. De hecho, alrededor de la página 280 en adelante, todo es simplemente excelente. Es muy buena la historia que nos presenta el autor. Pensaría que por esa parte final es por lo que muchos califican este libro como excelente, ya que sin esa calidad de esos últimos capítulos, el libro no pasaría de ser un texto regular.

En resumen, un libro aceptable, en el cual Liu Cixin elaboró magistralmente todo lo relacionado a la ciencia ficción, pero que le falto bastante en la elaboración de sus personajes. Sin embargo, ha sido una experiencia agradable leer por primera vez a un autor asiático. No estoy seguro de continuar la trilogía.

"I gave this book three stars because looking back, the beginning and middle felt drawn out. It was all very worth it, the way this story ties itself together and reveals the true villain of our story is brilliantly done. It’s truly brilliant. And the way we explore character in this sci-fi story is unlike any characterization I’ve come across within this genre. I loved the questions this book asked, and I love seeing perspectives from all sides of this story.

But there is a side to this book, specifically a side involving a VR game (believe it or not) that I thought was too drawn out, and hardly kept my interest (even when I did find those moments slightly interesting). And I understand the importance of these scenes to build towards the story’s big payoff. But going into this book knowing what this story is about (I won’t say it because it feels like a spoiler, even though it’s written on the back cover) left me recognizing where these VR scenes were going, and it took too long to get there.

The ending, while providing us with some of the most interesting perspectives I’ve seen in sci-fi, also fell flat. I can’t stand when the ending to a book in a series just rolls into the next book. I want to feel a conclusion to the story I’ve been reading while building excitement for the next one.

I gave this book a few knocks with this rating. I feel like I disagree with the three stars while also feeling like it fits perfectly. Three-Body Problem was a fantastic read and an incredible (seriously incredible) translation from a Chinese novel. I just wish it didn’t spend so much time building to something and instead gave us more of what that “something” is.

"I'm giving this five stars because some books just upend what you think about culture and science fiction, and it was awesome, and many other adjectives, and my brain may not be working properly right now.

I LOVED the science and math in this book. In fact, its content so outstripped my knowledge of the existence of concepts in scientific fields that in some instances I had no idea whether Liu was talking about reality or projected, futuristic reality.

Ye Wenjie's character is going to stick in my mind for a long time. She is the most complex, out-of-my-comfort-zone character I have read in a while. I was constantly going back and forth on whether her actions were good or bad, or undecipherable. How much did I not understand or couldn't empathize with because of cultural and societal differences?

Humanity is not homogeneous. Fiction plays a role in reminding us of this. Scientific communities are not homogeneous either. Science fiction should remind us of that too.

"This review was originally published on Avid Reviews: www.avidfantasyreviews.com

The first novel in the sensationally popular Chinese science fiction series has been translated into English for the first time in The Three-Body Problem. With the pacing of a thriller, the heart of a drama, and the intellectual stimulation of thought-provoking classic, this novel is sure to soon be as celebrated as much in the rest of the world as it currently is in China. It is rare to come across a story that is scientifically brilliant that also has a depth of character development and exploration that can bring the reader to tears. For this and many other reasons, The Three-Body Problem is one of my favorite reads of 2014, and a novel that I would recommend to any fan of speculative fiction who enjoys reading a novel that challenges the mind as well as entertains.

The novel follows the story of two main protagonists, Ye Wenjie and Wang Miao. Ye Wenjie’s story starts in the 1960’s during China’s cultural revolution. After she is forced to watch helplessly as her father is murdered because of his refusal to renounce his scientific ideals, her life starts to completely fall apart. When years later she finds herself in danger of facing the same fate as her father, she realizes the only way to stay alive is to use her skills as an astrophysicist to work for the Chinese government on a top-secret military project. Wang Miao’s story takes place decades later during a time when Chinese physicists are apparently committing suicide in alarming numbers. When Wang attempts to discover the reason behind these mysterious suicides, he unexpectedly comes across a game called The Three-Body Problem. Liu expertly weaves the stories of Ye, Wang, and The Three-Body problem together with the discovery of an alien civilization on the brink of destruction which plans to invade Earth. It is not until the story progresses to the point where the people of earth split into two competing factions- those that would welcome the aliens and those that would fight the invasion- that it becomes obvious to the reader that Liu has created a science fiction masterpiece that is meaningful on a variety of levels, and that will captivate and exhilarate readers from every corner of the globe.

Though the novel’s plot is a little slow at first, it quickly becomes incredibly fast paced and engaging. It is also a thought provoking story that blends in-depth character development and social commentary with complex scientific ideas. Liu makes the science fiction portion of the novel seem so plausible, and explains the intricate concepts behind his speculation in enough detail to make them fascinating and easy to grasp. The book’s setting also provided an educational opportunity to me, as I have not read much speculative fiction (or any kind of fiction I suppose) set in China and involving Chinese history and culture. I also found the translator’s footnotes fascinating, as they explained a lot of the references to everyday life and history in China. I know that most people do not usually read footnotes, but I highly recommend paying attention to those in this novel, as they really deepened my understanding of the story.

I was also impressed by how lyrical and stunning Liu’s writing could be despite the fact that I was only reading a translation. The translator did a wonderful job preserving Liu’s unique voice as a writer. He manages to use his skill with prose to draw the reader in, and his blend of many disparate elements that are both intellectual and thrilling to keep the reader engaged. Liu’s passion for physics and astrophysics comes across in his writing, and it is infectious. It has been a long time since I have read a science fiction novel that engaged me and made me so excited about the subject matter. It is easy to see why Liu’s series already has a cult following in China.

Currently China is going through the same golden age of science fiction that America experienced in the 50’s and 60’s. Their modernization and rapid advancement in technology has allowed the people of China to start looking towards the future, and this change in thinking has influenced China’s literary minds as well. This translation of The Three-Body Problem has transferred this excitement for Science Fiction back to our culture, and has re-vamped a genre that many literary critics have recently started to dismiss. Liu’s story is wonderful, but even if you read it and do not enjoy it, take some time to celebrate the fact that this novel has made a number of people who once would have dismissed speculative fiction to sit up and take notice of the genre. 2014 has been a year full of groundbreaking speculative fiction releases, and this novel in particular brings us one step closer to introducing the genre to a whole new subset of readers.

My rating: 9/10

I received a copy of this novel from Netgalley and the publisher in return for an honest review.

"Während der Kulturrevolution muss die junge Astrophysikerin Ye Wenjie mitansehen, wie ihr Vater, der ebenfalls Physiker ist, öffentlich zu Tode geprügelt wird. Später wird sie auf einen von der Außenwelt abgeschirmten Militärposten versetzt, wo im Geheimen nach intelligentem Leben im Weltall gesucht wird. Als tatsächlich ein Signal eingeht, nutzt sie die Chance, ihren eigenen Überzeugungen gemäß zu handeln. Rund 40 Jahre später wird der Nanotechnikforscher Wang Miao von der Polizei zur Aufklärung hinzugezogen, nachdem mehrere renommierte Wissenschaftler sich das Leben genommen haben. Dabei stößt er auf das Computerspiel Three Body, das in einer Welt spielt, in der sich chaotische mit stabilen Zeitaltern abwechseln. Dies kommt durch das sogenannte Dreikörperproblem zustande: Das System verfügt über drei Sonnen, die sich gegenseitig so beeinflussen, dass eine Prognose ihres Bahnverlaufs unmöglich wird. Zwischen diesem Computerspiel und den Physikersuiziden scheint ein Zusammenhang zu bestehen.

Das war keine leichte Kost, die ich mir als Erstlektüre für 2020 vorgenommen habe. Der Autor von „Die drei Sonnen“ verfügt offenbar über ein außergewöhnliches Wissen im Bereich der Physik und scheut sich nicht, seine Leser daran teilhaben zu lassen. Mit ein bisschen Hilfe von anderen Mitgliedern meiner Lesegruppe und Nachlesen bei Wikipedia konnte ich dem Buch jedoch über große Teile recht gut folgen. Größere Verständnisprobleme kamen erst gegen Ende des Buches auf (Stichwort Sophonen) und das Buch ließ sich schnell und flüssig lesen.

Wer allerdings nach Science-Fiction im Stile einer Space Opera sucht, sollte die Finger davon lassen. Das Buch spielt anders als die meisten anderen Sci-Fi-Romane in der Gegenwart und legt den Fokus eher auf die wissenschaftliche Seite der Science-Fiction. Auch sind die Charaktere keine Stärke des Buches, es gibt keine echte Identifikationsfigur und es geht in erster Linie um den Kontakt zur Trisolaris-Welt, die auch die Grundlage für das besagte Computerspiel bildet. Wenn man sich darauf einlässt und gewisse Merkwürdigkeiten erst einmal als gegeben akzeptiert, ist das Buch eine durchaus spannende und interessante Lektüre. Probleme hatte ich mit der erdachten Trisolaris-Kultur, die in Zyklen nach großen Katastrophen immer wieder neu entsteht. Dass solche Zyklen immer wieder zu fortgeschrittenen Zivilisationen führen können, die schließlich sogar der Menschheit weit überlegen sind, kann ich mir beim besten Willen nicht vorstellen. Das kaufe ich dem Autor einfach nicht ab. Vielleicht habe ich auch etwas falsch verstanden oder meine Kenntnisse reichen einfach nicht aus, um Lius Ideen folgen zu können. In dem Fall tue ich dem Buch wahrscheinlich unrecht. Es war jedoch dieser Aspekt, der meinen Genuss der Lektüre doch einigermaßen getrübt hat. Gleichzeitig finde ich jedoch das grundsätzliche Problem und die Frage, wie die Menschheit auf Kontakt mit einer eher feindlich gesinnten, überlegenen Kultur reagieren könnte, sehr spannend. Im Laufe des Buches stellt sich auch heraus, welches Sonnensystem mit Trisolaris gemeint ist, dies wiederum mit Hilfe von Wikipedia zu erkennen und nachzulesen, hatte schon einen angenehm-schaurigen Effekt.

Ich halte das Buch für lesenswert, Leser sollten sich jedoch vorab informieren, was sie da erwartet.

"In the deep silence of midnight, the universe revealed itself to its listeners as a vast desolation.

Dear Mr. Liu,
I've finally finished your Hugo award winning first installment (congrats by the way) featuring the Trisolarans who must flee their own doomed unstable world (a little cliché, don't you think?), seeking the more habitable living arrangements currently consumed by Earth's self destructive people.
Part I took off well as one of the book's protagonists, Ye Wenjie , witnesses the denouncement and torture of her father during China's Cultural Revolution, setting the stage for her bitterness and despondence over humankind as a progressive civilization. The chance encounter of an extraterrestrial message spurs a desperate reply:



There were a few spectacular visionary moments that orbit the fabrication of the Universe, a brief history of Earth's civilizations and hypotheses of the theory of everything based, I'm sure, on sound quantum physics, but reading through the theoretical astrophysics techno-babble plastered relentlessly in the narrative only served to put me off the next two books. I really want to find out more about the rise and fall of the Trisolarans civilizations and how the 'three body problem' might influence their interstellar journey but I'm not optimistic about picking up the next volume.

In the meantime, I'll eagerly await the well-earned certificate for completing your intriguing scientific philosophy course and will most likely tune in at the movies for the interpretation of this planetary triptych.

"Бунтът на гневния млад човек е много популярна идея в литературата. Чели сме стотици книги за гневни млади хора, които със своите надежди и трагични истории се приемат като представители на цяло поколение. “Трите тела” е поредния такъв роман и в същото време е роман, какъвто никога не сте чели. Той е едновременно настъпление към един нов свят и отстъпление от затвърденото разказване на историите за нови светове.

Залитането в полетото на физиката може да се стори объркващо за много читатели. Лиу Цъсин обаче е писател, който освен, че разбира от законите на физиката, разбира и от законите на човешката природа. А това ми помогна много да чета с интерес както историческата част от романа, така и фантастичната.

Накрая, но на последно място, бих обърнал внимание на още един аспект от мотива за гневния млад човек. Ако трябва да сравня Лиу Цъсин като творец, който си играе с тази идея, бих го сравнил не с други писатели, а с художника Хуан Миро. Бунтът на Миро еволюира в идеята “да убие картината” като изкуство, докато Лиу Цъсин изразява тази идея чрез главния му герой, който иска да убие науката като прогрес. И Миро, и героят на Цъсин правят по-живо от всякога това, което се опитват да убият.

"One of my best friends gifted me this 3 book box set this past Christmas. He must have had a crystal ball as unbeknownst to him I was heavily contemplating starting to read fiction again at that time period.

The hype that I missed about this book is not misplaced. I superbly enjoyed this book. It's heavy, philosophical, rooted in reality while being unknown.

The prose isn't stilted in the slightest and I'm immensely thankful to Ken Liu for the translation and exposing me, a westerner, to Chinese Science fiction. I've since acquired all of Cixin Liu's novels and anything Ken Liu has translated.

I really appreciated how it blended history seamlessly with science fiction, the science itself is well thought out and heavy. I personally loved the authors take on the aliens, rather than give into the common belief that because aliens are advanced they'll somehow decide to show us the way to peace, instead they see us as bugs to be squashed.

Philosophically I really appreciated this approach as well, instead of us looking to the stars for some civilization to come to us and fix all our problems why don't we instead turn inward now and try to fix what we can on this earth while preparing for a fight should an advanced race find us.

I'm on board the hype train!

"Sci-fi is not my typical thing—but I’m trying to expand my palate. This particular fare is “hard science,” and reminds me a lot of my days of yore reading Michael Crichton (though with even less character development). Almost completely devoid of literary value, this book is essentially a substrate for presenting mind-bending scientific theories. And on this score it succeeds. It has stock characters whose humanity is substituted by—basically—scientific treatises and articles. So I will not pan this based on literary value—that’s not its point. In fact, the author says in the afterword that science tells a better story than any poet or novelist ever could. I disagree, but I understand the author’s point of view. In the end, I couldn’t stop reading this one because its ideas were so intriguing. I even bought the next two books in the series. If Scientific American, etc. is a little too opaque for you (it often was for me) and if you cannot get enough Carlo Rovelli (I love his books!), books like these are great ways to ingest and consider imaginative presentations of cutting-edge science.

"Second read: I was reading this book while watching the Tencent's drama adaptation (which is different with the upcoming Netflix one). Watching the well-adapted drama made appreciate the book more since it made some storyline changes, and and portray the Three Body game into a such a wonderful visual feast. The human computer scene especially. Anyway, now I have motivation to continue reading the trilogy.


First read:
This is an edited review after I watched the Hugo Awards ceremony. Seriously, this novel won? While the idea is interesting, it lacks the number one ingredient for a good novel: coherent writing. It was choppy as hell and the characters were either unrelatable or one-dimensional or downright flat.

I hope it did not win just because of some political correctness reason. Just because a novel is different (and a translated work, no less), it does not make it a winner. At least for me.

"It started off pretty well with three seemingly unrelated threads, Wang Mio a nanotech scientist , a past research station ‘Red Coast’ that was searching for alien life, and a virtual reality game called the three body problem. You knew they would fit together in some way and they do, but not until you have worked your way through endless pages in which people and plot slowly fade into the background and make way for long scientific and technological exposition. There was one time I thought I had opened and was reading my microwave user’s manual by mistake. It leans a little too much over to hard science fiction for me, but I recognize why the techies among us might really enjoy it.

"Я чесно дуже хотіла полюбити цю історію, адже тут така чудова ідея і… не змогла. По-перше, дуже субʼєктивно: ця фантастика для мене видалася дуже твердою. За наукою тут мені складно було знайти хоч якийсь сюжет. Описи всіх фізичних процесів мене втомлювали, а тому паралельно я брала на допомогу аудіокнигу (до речі, геніально озвучену!)

Я все чекала «контакту», думала, навколо нього буде обертатися сюжет книжки, бо люблю цю тему в НФ (ну і це зазначено в анотації) але через довбану анотацію я собі нафантазувала зовсім іншого і тому тут потрапила на гачок «книга не така, як я очікувала». Чия це проблема? Моя, звісно. В ідеалі добре було б не знати, про що буде книжка, яка центральна таємниця, таким чином історія заграє для вас іншими фарбами. Я ж така читала «ну де вже, де? Агов, ну де? 60% книжки, дееее ВІН?» 🤪🔭

Щоб не закривати цей відгук спойлером, скажу лише, що я очікувала точно чогось іншого. Звертаю увагу на те, що книжка нап��сана не в сучасному стилі, а ніби їй вже 50-70 років.

Парадоксально, я майже нічого не зрозуміла з наукової точки зору, але читати мені було…досить жваво! Як так? Сама не розумію. Ця книжка просто ідеальний представник фрази «дуже цікаво і зовсім нічого не зрозуміло».

А ще, як на мене, автор забагато уваги присвячує грі. Це важливий момент (але ми ж це дізнаємося не відразу) і для мене була каторга читати розділи про гру, відводити відсотків 40 на це - занадто (знову ж, це дуже субʼєктивно, бо може, хтось навпаки в тому знайшов найкращий елемент історії).

Підводячи підсумок: це НЕ погана книга, вона просто не для мене. Я люблю більш гуманітарну нф, або ж коли автори пояснюють наукові факти простіше (привіт Кідруку). Тут були дуже емоційні діалоги і я декілька разів навіть плакала, автор піднімає дуже важливі теми, що стосуються всього людства, але продовження читати найближчим часом я не буду. Нехай трохи повариться в моїй свідомості. Тепер щодо оцінки: оскільки я точно не цільова аудиторія «Проблеми трьох тіл» я не буду ставити оцінку, щоб не занижувати її рейтинг.

"Dry and surreal.

This story jumps around in time, telling a story from many angles and trusting the reader to be smart enough to keep up...only to suddenly change gears and explain carefully built-up mysteries with a chunks of ""maid and butler"" expository dialogue in time to staring to build the next mystery.

This may be an artifact of being translated from Chinese, I don't know. It wasn't a deal-breaker, it was just odd.

The style reminded me of era Asimov.

Also, some similar ideas are explored in the late 70's novel by Charles Sheffield.

Book #1 by Liu Cixin develops a complicated scenario in which another planet has contact with humans. Her story has multiple, complicated, and divergent threads that are slowly pulled together into a cohesive trajectory. Beginning with the background of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and moving to the present and beyond, it is a mind boggling world that I sometimes had a hard time wrapping my feeble head around. The audio was a bit confusing due to my unfamiliarity with Chinese names and certain scientific principleS and I recommend a print version.

Нечасто на українському читацькому просторі можна зустріти переклади китайських творів, а тим більше роботи сучасних наукових фантастів. Найбільшою проблемою є те, що знайти хорошого перекладача в такому випадку дуже важко. А тим більше для творів у жанрі тяжкої наукової фантастики, де, окрім багатьох наукових термінів, є місце неіснуючим технологіям і поняттям, релігіям чи специфіці нації. Та й узагалі азійська література мало представлена на нашому ринку. Тому, коли у нас виходять такі книги, які ще й є дуже популярними у своїх країнах, увага та цікавість до них є ��ільшою, ніж до інших видань. Насамперед потрібно похвалити перекладача, Євгена Широноса, який за освітою не є лінгвістом і немає багато досвіду в перекладацькій справі. Я б узагалі назвав його супергероєм, який узявся за такий великий амбітний проект як переклад трилогії Лю Цисіня «Пам’ять про минуле Землі». Першим таким супергероєм для мене став Богдан Стасюк із перекладом «Гіперіона», якому теж довелося добре попрацювати, щоб ми отримали якісне українське видання.

Автор є дуже популярним у Китаї та вважається головним обличчям сучасної китайської наукової фантастики і отримав безліч нагород у себе в країні та поза її межами. Навчався він на технічній спеціальності в «Північному китайському університеті водного господарства та електроенергетики» та довгий час працював комп’ютерним інженером на електростанції в Янцюане, що знаходиться в провінції Шаньсі. Цікавим є факт, що його дружина та дочка не дуже знайомі з його романами та оповіданнями. Найбільшої популярності Лю Цисінь отримав завдяки своїй трилогії «Пам’ять про минуле Землі», яка в нього на батьківщині більше відома за назвою першої книжки «Проблема трьох тіл», що отримала премію «Гюґо» за найкращий фантастичний роман.

Назва роману вибрана не просто так, тому що автор узяв за основу ідею задачі трьох тіл, яка на даний час є нерозв’язаною і належить до царини класичної небесної механіки. Ісаак Ньютон уперше сформулював її в одній зі своїх філософських робіт, де роздумував про рух Місяця в гравітаційному полі Сонця та Землі. Лю Цисінь майстерно обіграв наукову сторону цієї задачі разом із проблемами контакту людства із позаземними цивілізаціями. Але в цьому романі немає однозначної думки та порядку дій, що потрібно робити в такому випадку. Насправді автор показує зовсім різну реакцію, поведінку та дії людей із багатьох ракурсів щодо ймовірної зустрічі з інопланетною расою. У книзі багато роздумів на рахунок усіляких можливих наслідків такого контакту, що відкривають багато деталей людської поведінки з огляду на речі, які впливали на неї впродовж усього життя. Сюжет книги без усяких умовностей розділений на дві різні епохи в історії Китаю, які міцно переплетені з головними героями та маленькими порціями відкривають загальну картину, яку розповідає Лю Цисінь.

«Перша порожнеча, яку я створив у своїй уяві, була нескінченністю простору. У ній не було нічого, навіть світла. Але незабаром я усвідомив, що цей порожній всесвіт не зможе змусити мене відчути тишу. Замість цього порожнеча наповнила мене незрозумілим почуттям занепокоєння, викликаючи, як у потопельника, бажання вхопитися за що-небудь.»

Першою — є Культурна революція в Китайській республіці, де самотня жінка-астрофізик, Є Веньцзє, відчуває на собі усю правдивість та силу тодішнього тоталітарного режиму Мао Цзедуна. Вона стає свідком переслідування та вбивства батька, який просто хотів захистити фізику від маоїстської ідеології. Ця частина книжки багато розповідає про криваву сторінку в історії Китаю, яку розпочала комуністична партія того часу. Переслідування культурних діячів, артистів, письменників, вчених та страх виступити проти партії дуже схожі до певного періоду нашої історії. Тому так само й тут, ті, хто не були згодні із культурним вченням Мао Цзедуна, були вигнані з країни, ув’язнені чи розстріляні. Усі події, які трапилися із головною героїнею в цей період її життя, сильно вплинули на бачення щодо розвитку та місця людства на Землі та й у Всесвіті загалом. Я взагалі не дуже сильно знайомий з історією розвитку Китаю, тому все описане автором було для мене новим та неймовірно цікавим.

Другою епохою є початок XXI, де другий головний герой, Ван Мяо, зустрічається з дивними подіями, що відбуваються у світовій науці. Сам він працює у сфері нанотехнологій, або, іншими словами, наномолекулярних технологій, що спрямовані на дослідження маніпуляцій з окремими атомами й молекулами для формування певних матеріальних структур із наперед визначеними властивостями. Результатом таких експериментів було винайдено відомі на сьогодні графенові трубки або вуглецеві нанотрубки, що є дуже міцними в певній своїй структурі. Прискорювачі заряджених частинок (електронів, протонів, неонів) видають неоднозначні результати, що вводить у ступор не тільки Ван Мяо, а й науковців із цілого світу. Якраз йому й перепадає гірка доля розібратися в загадкових подіях, що відбуваються на Землі та в самому Китаї.

Неозброєним оком помітно, що книжку написав не американський чи європейський письменник. Лю Цисінь піднімає питання розвитку Китаю в космічній галузі та дослідженні позаземного життя у світовій історії. Тому сюжет та герої сприймаються зовсім по-іншому. Часто може здатися, що герої виглядають закритими та незрозумілими у своїх вчинках. А їхня глибока середина просто відсутня. Але ж ми звикли до іншої літератури, а тут ми маємо менше шаблонів і більше китайської нації, де присутня не близька для нас історія та менталітет. Тому придивившись детальніше знаходиш ті зернятка, які показують нам справжні почуття та біль головних чи другорядних героїв.

А ще автор зачіпає проблему екології на нашій планеті та відверте ігнорування цього людиною. Також піднімає питання релігії, її мінливості під впливом невідомих для людини речей. З огляду на різні аспекти та проблеми, я б виділив три основні ідеї, які бажає донести Лю Цисінь, а саме відносини людини до людини, людини до природи та людини до космосу. Людина, як створіння, ніколи не вчиться на своїх помилках, які не мають рахунку, ніколи не задовольняється тим, що має, чи тим чого досягла. Вона із повільною впевненістю веде людство та Землю до загибелі. Так, ми давно показуємо свою силу, але природа у вигляді катаклізмів показує іншу сторону, яку людство старається не помічати. Хто ми є на цій планеті? Створіння, які вважають себе богами? Чи просто купка організмів, які є маленькою часткою всього незвіданого в цьому Всесвіті?

На перший погляд може здатися, що книжка є якимось науковим твором і не підійде для пересічного читача. Так, вона належить до тяжкої наукової фантастики й не схожа ні на «Марсіанина» Енді Вейра, ні на «Путівник по галактиці для космотуристів» Дуґласа Адамса чи на «Сталевого Щура» Гаррі Гаррісона. Цей роман більше схожий на «Гіперіон» Дена Сіммонса за своєю потужністю та глобальністю. Але багато складного, описано досить таки науково-популярно, що дає можливість із легкістю насолодитися текстом. Окрім того тут присутньо багато роздумів, історій та поведінки людини в складних ситуаціях, що теж є цікавим. Тому я б радив хоча б спробувати почитати цю книжку людям, у яких панічний страх до такого типу літератури, бо ж ви знайдете для себе те, що вам сподобається.

Коли я читав цей роман, то бували моменти, що я зупинявся і відкладав книжку убік та йшов займатися іншими справами. А все через те, що емоції були занадто сильними і я розумів, що якщо продовжу, то точно проведу безсонну ніч допоки не дочитаю до кінця. Тому впевнено кажу, що в цьому читацькому році маю дві прочитані книжки, які є дуже сильні в емоційному та психологічному планах, «Воно» Стівена Кінга та «Проблема трьох тіл» Лю Цисіня. Тепер залишається тільки чекати на переклад другого роману із трилогії та роздумувати про існування позаземного життя. А ми точно не самотні в цьому недослідженому та безмежному Всесвіті.

"Ye Wenjie lost everything in the Cultural Revolution: her home, her job, her parents, her hope. She watched silently and helplessly as her father was beaten to death during a struggle session for his refusal to renounce Einstein and science. She agreed when she was sent off to a logging camp that stripped an ancient forest into a muddy no-man's-land. And when another comrade's false charges gave her the choice between prison and work in a dangerous top-secret facility, she acquiesced to that too.

Nearly half a century later, Wang Miao, a hardworking nanotech scientist, is facing the end of physics. An inexplicable epidemic has quietly struck China's scientists. Again and again, physicists have apparently committed suicide, their only explanation a variation on the theme
As Wang attempts to discover what is affecting the scientists, he is introduced to a peculiar and mysterious game, the Three-Body Problem, a virtual world of chaos and confusion that begins to bleed into his reality.

The three-body problem referenced in the title is simple to state: given three points' locations, starting velocities, and accelerations, where will they be at a given time? But the problem is surprisingly difficult. Hundreds of years ago, Poincare proved that there is no analytical solution via integrals. A few years ago, a solution was found via infinite sums, but convergence is so slow that estimation from this technique is essentially impossible. The novel extends this principle: put enough events into motion, and even if you understand their individual trajectories, no one can predict their outcome.

The is an interesting fusion of cultural commentary and science fiction. Much of the core of the story takes place during the revolution, and I was fascinated to see how deeply politics managed to worm itself into every aspect of life. For instance, during the heat of the revolution, the revolutionaries argue that Einstein's theory of relativity is too reactionary to be taught in schools:


Initially, the story is slow-paced and reflective, focused on the changes that the revolution wrought upon society. Although I have never read the story in its original language, I think the translation captures the evocative lyricism of the novel:

As the story's political elements collide with the scientific ones, the plot begins to take some utterly bizarre turns. The plot examines themes of classism and nationalism, of faith and nihilism, and above all, of choices and their consequences. Wang is a likeable protagonist, and I especially enjoyed his interactions with the sarcastic and irascible policeman Da Shi. I also enjoyed the absurd, illuminating, almost hallucinogenic moments inside the Game. Although the story became a bit too implausible and bizarre for me, I was captivated to the end, and I think one of my favourite aspects was the author's exploration of China's political evolution.

In the world that Cixin Liu creates, perspective is everything. Politics, economics, and science shift endlessly and unpredictably, and a great leap forward can too easily become a tumble. As one character puts it,


As Wang and Ye begin to realise, like the points in a three-body system, small decisions cause tiny perturbations that can be pushing events towards a destination that no one could have imagined.

"I sense a book hangover coming on. This novel is different, and very hard on the science fiction. There is a lot of physics talk. I never took physics. Science is not my thing. Of all the classes I've ever taken, the only one I almost failed was my 10th grade honors biology. And that was just biology. My brain just can't interpret information when you break it down to cellular levels. There was an entire chapter towards the end that was entirely science, talking about unfolding protons into various dimensions and what that would look like. My mind just about broke.

Other than that- I very much enjoyed everything else. Part one is an interesting introduction to the Chinese Cultural Revolution and I am interested in learning more about it. It seems like it was a chaotic era (haha!) in which Mao was trying in earnest to break down the barriers in socioeconomic status at the cost of human lives, advancing science, and restricting trade/capitalism. From the little bit of outside information I glanced at regarding this period, it seems people are still undecided about Mao's character (hero or villain).

Part two is when we start to get to the heart of everything (possible minor spoilers ahead). Our MC Wang Miao, begins playing a very strange game focused on solving the three-body problem (a planet stuck in the gravitational pull of three different stars). During the game we see various prominent scientific historical figures (Sir Isaac Newton, Galileo, etc.) interacting with other game characters and offering their theories on the three-body problem.

The game scenes were absolutely hysterical to me. The Three-Body Problem is so serious- the excerpts from the game are laughable to the point of absurdity and provided some much needed comic relief. I don't know if they were intended to be seen that way by the author or translator, but the chapter with Newton was absolute gold.

The characters were mostly excellent. Wang is pretty bland and dry and seems to have no personality at all. Da Shi/Shi Qiang provided additional comic relief. He was a jerk, but he was a very clever jerk and I adored every scene he was in (especially his revelations at the end- take that scientists!). Ye Wenjie's tale is haunting and tragic and I also enjoyed her scenes.

As the plot unfolds there were a few twists and turns. I really loved the parallels that were drawn between (MAJOR)


I will definitely continue the series and highly recommend this to all sci-fi fans.

"No sabría cómo describir este libro salvo con... ""WOW""

Creo que el Problema de los Tres Cuerpos es uno de los pocos libros en los que entiendo que no tenga ni sinopsis.

Este libro ha sido un tremendo viaje en todos los sentidos. Es cierto que empecé el libro sintiéndome un poco tonto porque pensé que no iba a entender nada del mismo, pero en cuanto la trama llegó a cierto punto todo cambió.
La manera en la que el autor te va introduciendo elementos de ciencia ficción en el mundo real es muy orgánica, haciendo que sientas la trama ""real"" y que podría ser posible.

La parte de la realidad virtual está puesta al inicio como ""azar"", pero luego toma todo el sentido e hila con la trama principal de una manera espectacular.

Y me encantaría poder hablar del libro, pero pasado este punto no haría más que entrar en spoilers claves para la trama. Sólo puedo decir que el personaje de Wang es increíble.

✅Pros✅

🛸 Es un libro que, a pesar de ser Ciencia Ficción, podría llegar a ser verdad.
🛸 En el momento que el libro te hace ""click"" y las piezas empiezan a encajar, es un viaje maravilloso.
🛸 Historias del pasado y presente perfectamente entrelazadas.
🛸 El plot del final es inolvidable.
🛸 Al acabar el libro vas a cuestionarte hasta tu existencia.


❌Contras❌

❌ Es un libro al que cuesta mucho entrar, precisamente por los términos técnicos y lo obtuso que es el inicio.
❌ Los nombres chinos lían bastante a un lector occidental. Si no estás habituado a ellos por otras obras, series o animes puedes perderte un poco.
❌ Libro muy reflexivo, por lo que si te gusta más la acción, te va a sacar mucho de la obra.

Como conclusión diré que, al menos en mi caso, es un libro que me ha abierto mucho la mente. Me ha mostrado cómo con unos pocos términos científicos se puede crear una historia que te atrapa desde el minuto uno.

Tengo muchísimas ganas de leer el segundo libro de la saga y, ahora entiendo, por qué muchos lectores de Sci-fi consideran esta obra una de las mejores del género nunca escritas.

5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ estrellas conseguidas a pulso y está nominado a libro del año por mi parte. Es MAGNÍFICO.

"I'm a fast reader and it rarely happens that I try hard to read a book as slow as possible to enjoy it as much as possible. The first time reading experience of a book is very precious and can be experienced only once. This book was absolutely fantastic, wonderful, critical, complex and exotic, all at the same time. I loved the Chinese background with the multiple layers of story with the ""Three Body"" game, the different time layers and the Trisolaris culture. Also, it had so many great science facts in it but the author was very skilful in making it very accessible. (Still, I'm not sure if someone who is not interested in Science Fiction would have the same wonderful experience as I did.) It's science fiction after all and it incorporates lots of science facts at several points.
This book was very creative and inspiring from my point of view, and I couldn't stop thinking about it even after I turned the last page. A very mysterious, interesting, fun book with wit and gravity! I can't wait to read the next book.

"2024 Update: I AM VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM ANYONE WHO HAS BOTH READ THIS BOOK AND WATCHED THE NETFLIX ADAPTATION!

Re-read as an audiobook 2017.

Right up until this book took a really far out turn for the final few chapters I was spellbound. Which isn't to say I hated those final chapters, per se, more that I would have preferred to keep some mystery at play before the second book finally (soon, hopefully!*) gets released in an English translation.

Spanning lightyears and decades, ""Three Body"" is very much a story for the malaise of ""Earth Civilization"" as we advance uncertainly into the 21st century. I won't mention any plot points here, frankly, because I hope you will be delighted by being consistently surprised as I was.

Top recommendation.

"Проблемът с трите слънца няма решение. Играта на еволюция е вечна!

Страхотно бестселърско начало на епична Sci-Fi сага. В същото време теми, които не са най-масовите като:
- еволюционни теории
- физика и астрофизика
- фундаментална наука
- философия
- виртуална реалност
са примесени така, че да е зарибяващо за много широк кръг от читатели.

Приключение на въображението.
Доколкото разбрах, авторът е имал притеснения за реакцията в Китай по политически съображения, но всъщност се е приела много добре. В международен план успехът също е напълно заслужен.

Използвана е игра с виртуална реалност за постигане на определени цели в изграждането и запознаването ни с един екзоземен свят. Паралелно действието си се развива и в наши модерни дни, което създава интересна перспектива. Няма човек, на който моментът с описанието на ""компютър от човеци"" да не му се стори забавен, а също така и да се замисли за метафората.

Buena obra de ciencia ficción, tiene mucho dato técnico pero es muy comprensible a nivel general. La parte que más me ha gustado es la del juego ""tres cuerpos"", y además aporta bastante a la trama.

Sobre los personajes, no me decido si me parecen bien trabajados o no, porque da tanto giro cada uno que a veces se llegan a contradecir.
Espero con muchas ganas leer los siguientes, y más aún con el final que tiene.

Good work of science fiction, it has a lot of technical data but is very understandable on a general level. The part that I liked the most is the ""three bodies"" game, and it also adds a lot to the plot.

Regarding the characters, I can't decide if they seem well worked or not, because each one gives so much twist that sometimes they contradict each other. I really look forward to reading the next ones, and even more so with the ending it has.

"10/6
""Problem trzech ciał"" jest nie tylko powieścią science fiction, ale także odważnym pytaniem o miejsce ludzkości w kosmosie. Cixin Liu wykreował fabułę pełną konfliktów moralnych i etycznych, które są tak stare jak ludzkość, a jednak świeże w kontekście międzygwiezdnych rozważań. To literatura, która wymaga od czytelnika nie tylko wyobraźni, ale i refleksji, prowokując do zastanowienia nad tym, co nas definiuje jako ludzi. Nie przeczę, to trudna powieść, ale wynagradza każdą zaangażowaną w nią minutę. A finał sprawia, że można zbierać szczękę z podłogi.

"Since the second half of the twentieth century, physics had gradually lost the concision and simplicity of its classical theories. Modern theoretical models have become more and more complex, vague, and uncertain. Experimental verification has become more difficult as well. This is a sign that the forefront of physics research is hitting a wall.

What do you do when you hit a wall? In science-fiction literature, many authors turned their backs on the hard-science of Arthur C Clarke or Isaac Asimov, Greg Bear or Gregory Benford and prefer to focus on space opera or comic book superheroes that play fast and loose with the laws of physics. [The Expanse is excused here, because I happen to like it]

I didn’t really enjoy Liu Cixin, rating him about ** for plot and characters, but his scientific credentials and his provocative theories have kept me going and might even make me pick up the next two books in the series. Liu Cixin dares to go explore the cutting edge of modern theoretical physics in an attempt to breach that real wall encountered by experimental scientists who try to find evidence of subatomic particles, and for this I believe he deserves all the praise and all the prizes he received.

Instead of Clarke, this first novel by him reminded me more of Truffaut and Spielberg collaborating on “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” : the series speculates about a first contact with an alien civilization. The first episode covers the discovery stage of the fact that we are not alone in the universe. The title, mysterious for about the first half of the book to those who don’t know that the is a mathematical model for complex orbital trajectories, is also a reference for the Trisolaran civilization, the aliens that first respond to our radio signals from the seventies.

As I said, I was not bowled over by the plot, but for what it’s worth, the story is anchored by two characters: Ye Wenjie, an astrophysicist working at a Chinese radio telescope listening to the noise from deep space in the 1960s to 1980s, hoping one day these random background sounds will turn into an intelligent message, and Wang Miao, a nanotechnology professor working on practical applications in the third millennium.



The life story of Ye Wenjie starts during the Cultural Revolution in China with her father stoned to death by rabid students drunk on their own power. The first chapters of the novel are rather heavy handed in their political messaging, and this partisanship doesn’t get much balanced in the rest of the book. Fortunately for me, science sort of takes over, once Wenjie is assigned to her new secret listening station.



Liu Cixin can write, as shown here, with emotion and even some poetic flair about our place in the universe, an aspect of the novel that makes me gloss over more easily about what I perceived as shortcomings in his plot construction [a lot of exposition through confessional chapters].

A time jump of about three decades introduces the other lead character, professor Wang, who finds himself embroiled in a complex conspiracy with global ramifications. There’s also a hardboiled detective whose name didn’t really register with me.
They are tasked to investigate an epidemic of suicides and ‘accidental’ deaths among top scientists both in China and around the world. All of these incidents seemed linked with a secretive organization known as E.T.A. and Wang’s research takes him first to an elderly Ye Wenjie, now retired, and then to a virtual reality game named ‘The Three Body Problem’, about a civilization that is systematically and chaotically destroyed by celestial forces outside their control or understanding.



Once again, I feel the need to remark on the quality of the description, thanks either to the author or to his English translator who is himself an excellent SF author. I enjoyed the virtual reality chapters more than the political reminiscences, and they are probably the hook that draws the readers into the story best, preparing them for the revelations that come like a flood in the second half of the novel: realizing that we are not alone in the universe, after all.



So please be advised that the rest of my review can contain spoilers as I try to organize my thoughts into a coherent image for future reference [such as reading the sequels]

>>><<<>>><<<

E.T.A. stands in for Earth-Trisolaran Alliance, a group of scientists and big money sponsors who try to prepare for the arrival of our aliens. They work from the shadows, they put Ye Wenjie as the figurehead leader of the movement since she is the one who both sent the greeting message form Earth and received the answer. But they are also split into warring factions about how to prepare humanity for the arrival of the Trisolarans.
I sort of liked the speculative part of this second half of the novel better than the first, with its focus on sociology and its more general critique of our current suicidal tendencies as a species.
An early reference to by Rachel Carson, a book about the destruction of the environment through pesticides and deforestation, is mirrored in the actual biographical notes of the author as a catalyst for his engagement in the issues covered in his fiction.

Many in the ETA movement feel that humanity must be stopped from destroying the planet by any means necessary: . Ye Wenjie is only the first to start the ball of retribution through alien threat rolling. There are many willing hands to take her message into eco-terrorism territory. They call themselves the Adventists.


Another faction within the ETA delegate all their free will and responsibility to a mythical father figure, choosing faith over rational thought. They call themselves the Redemptionists, and I believe there is no shortage of examples of their mentality in the real world, with so many people ready to follow blindly venal preachers and faith healers.


The third major faction in the movement call themselves the Survivors, people who look after their own interests as a priority and are ready to become a fifth column that will betray humanity in the hope the aliens will keep them as pets, or something of the sort:

I didn’t feel the need to imagine myself joining any of these factions, because there is a fourth choice, exemplified by Wang and his policeman friend: the skeptics, the humanists who still believe in humankind’s ability to rise to the occasion and take the future into its own hands.




James Randi is no longer among us, but I cheered when I found him mentioned in the novel, even if not by name. Wang and his allies are presented with hard evidence that the long established classical laws of physics have gone haywire, but they refuse to believe their own eyes and suspect someone with a personal agenda is playing mind games with them.
This is what I consider a healthy, progressive attitude, directly to be transferred from the fictional world of the Three Bodies to our current affairs. This is also the traditional role of the science-fiction author, as expressed in the Golden Age by Bradbury and by many of his peers: to read the signs of doom in our current affairs and extrapolate; to imagine the worst so that we can prepare in advance and be ready to face it when the time comes.



In the novel, this is organized by ETA radicals. In our world, by political and industrial pressure groups. Yet I personally remain a firm believer in science and in the skeptic method of assessing evidence.

Because of this training I had as an engineer [Liu Cixin is also an engineer in cybernetics], I was curious to check out some of the more far flung theories presented in the novel, with mixed results:



This was the biggest stumbling block for me in the science of the Trisolarans. I thought it was too fanciful and too convenient for where the author wanted to take his story. There is some theoretical support for Liu Cixin’s arguments [ in the currently accepted form of string theory, but we don’t yet have the experimental methods to verify those mathematical formulas.

seems like another whopper of a fact to swallow, but in the author’s defence, he hasn’t told us anything about the physical form of the Trisolarans. We have been trained since the start of the genre to imagine aliens as humanoid in shape, but I have a hunch that the next book will not subscribe to this theorem. I know that some spores can survive the radiation and the cold of outer space.

Monofilaments that can cut through anything have been postulated before, and I have no quarrels with them. What I do have a problem with is their practical application
.

The novel stops here, centuries before the alien fleet is set to arrive for the announced invasion. This is a strong motivator for me to continue with the series [what happens next?], although I am a little wary about the increase in the page count. I feel like the author needs either to improve his characters and his plot if he wants to keep me invested, or present it in a tighter package.

"Sciencefiction is a genre that delivers books that are fun, some extensions of tv series, movies, games and such.
Good scifi is the real deal and is mindblowing at the least, which is the case with this Chinese scifi novel. Its themes are extraterrestrial contact which leads to the promise of an invasion in the future.
It all starts in the Chinese revolution where the world should be changed and leads to a job in a listeningpost concerned with communication with the extra territorial.
So they get an answer from out there and the response leads to the invitation to Come to our world.
Which leads to various factions in the world concerning the coming of this invasions of Aliens.
The book is full of great and interesting ideas which makes for interesting reading. That said the characters in this novel are with the exception of an annoying Chinese detective mostly forgetable. Thankfully the themes in this book feel original and interesting which drive the story mostly.
Having seen 3/4 of the Netflix show I can safely say that they have improved upon the characters even if the have removed some of the original Chinese heritage from the novel, and managed to not dumb down the plot.

The book stops where the tvshow still continues. Reading scifi was something I did a lot as a teenager before moving on to the more thriller and pulpnovels. However reading this quality always brings me back to the table when it comes to scifi. I hope the tvshow gives the bookseries a boost and brings new readers to genre.

Well worth your readingtime.

"As much as most people think of spaceships and lasers when they hear science fiction, the heart of science fiction is a story about human nature based around some futuristic technology. Be it faster than light travel, artificial gravity, or technological immortality the essence of sci-fi is to explore how these changes impact human society. In this way 'The Three Body Problem' is a very successful science fiction story.

Before I get into the meat of my review I would like to highlight that this was originally written in Chinese for a Chinese audience. As such it doesn't have the same story structure and plot beats that most Western science fiction have. This isn't a bad thing, just something to note as the flow and pace of the story is quite different from most of the books I have read.

From here on out there are some minor spoilers, so tread lightly. But the nickel tour is this book is a really great story with a few clunky parts that nevertheless leaves me eager to get to the next installment. Highly recommended for the science fiction aficionado.

But first a three body gif:



(As far as the title goes, it is a reference to a famous physics/math problem called, not surprisingly, . This problem relates to calculating the movement of three bodies of mass in a space as they influence each other's velocity by their gravitational fields. The math is bonkers and has yet to be fully solved.)

So the question as the heart of The Three Body Problem is how would humanity react to the discovery of intelligent extraterrestrial life. How will that discovery make people view themselves, humanity, and humanity's legacy to earth. Not surprisingly there is a diverse reaction with some looking to the aliens as a hope to redeem humanity's failings, others hoping the aliens wipe out humanity, while others planning to resist in anyway they can.

But this isn't a straightforward reveal with a linear progression of the story. The reveal for aliens is pretty deep in the book while lots of weird things befall humanity's scientists leading up to that point. We get character flashbacks to the and see how that period influenced their outlook on humanity. While we mostly follow the perspective of one character, there are a fair amount of expositional passages that serve to fill in the reader on other events and happenings. I would say the only stumbling point for this book is the extensive use of expositional passages. I feel like there were more effective ways to get this information across then large passages of data dumping.

Still, the story is very compelling with lots of twists and turns. I had no idea where the story would be heading. Was the world really a simulation and the break down of our laws a physics just a glitch in the programming? Were aliens already among us? Were aliens just a cover story for an insidious human conspiracy? These questions and each new revelation kept me turning pages to find out when the next shoe would drop. Hopefully the success of this series will bring more Chinese sci-fi to English. This book was a thrill to read and if the Chinese have more of where it came they need to send it stateside.

"I'd been meaning to read The Three-Body Problem since it was first published in German a few years back but was deterred by its length and the supposedly complicated writing: I shouldn't have been; I found the novel to be a quick and mostly easy read. There is a lot of talk about physics and at first I kept trying to double check whether it made any sense to me but then I decided to take it the way you'd take sci-fi talk in, say, Star Trek, and just buy into whatever the author claimed. From then-on it was smooth sailing.

The novel starts out strong: For the first 100 pages I was sucked in and especially the parts about the brutality of the cultural revolution was fascinating. Sadly, it fell apart rather quickly after that.

I had several problems with this novel: Firstly, while I understand this is a triology, the 550+ pages of this novel feel only like the beginning of a story. There is no real pay off at the end and the explanation we do get are bizarre. I don't buy for a minute that this is how people would react to something so otherwordly. The story was written in segments for a sci-fi magazine first and you can really feel that. The quality differs greatly between parts and the ebb and flow is odd to say the least. Then there's the characters who are all paper thin and pale (one of the more interesting ones was introduced in the last 50 pages), and the dialogue is unrealistic and very wooden. And more of a personal gripe: I greatly dislike scenes set in virtual reality games - I feel about them like I feel about dream sequences - and almost half the novel is written in-game, which I found very frustrating and boring to read.

Overall, I found some of the ideas in this novel fascinating, I enjoyed both the physics and the political aspect, and occasionally the story telling was gripping, but overall the execution is pretty rough. This book is very heavy on telling a story, not so much on showing. A lot of it is one person telling another person the story in monologue style. In the end, this is just not very good writing.

While I'm a little curious how the trilogy continues, I don't think I will read on. I'll continue my search for well-written Sci-Fi.

(I saw some reviews critical of the German translation, but I thought it was pretty good most of the time.)

"These are the rules of the game of civilization: The first priority is to guarantee the existence of the human race and their comfortable life. Everything else is secondary.

I enjoyed this one a lot more than I expected to (which is perhaps an odd thing to say about such a highly regarded novel) and even more of a pleasant surprise was how little I took issue with the some of the elements that are touted as being weak (such as the characters and the video-game sub-plot). In fact the video-game sub-plot was actually one of the most interesting elements for me.

Anyway, overall I'd say this is really bloody good and high up there on the list of modern hard sci-fi for readability and enjoyment factor while also being chock-full of jargon. There were definitely some parts where there was so much science-speak that my mind was a tad bit boggled and overheated a little, but it didn't affect my enjoyment all that much.

The two main characters, Wang Miao and Ye Zhetai, were much more compelling than I expected (particularly Ye) and certainly better than most characters I've come across in golden-age hard sci-fi. I also liked the blend between Wang's modern-day storyline and Ye's storyline against the backdrop of the Cultural Revolution. I feel like I maybe would have had a bit of a better time if I knew more about China's Cultural Revolution, but it was still interesting without that knowledge.

For me, the main thing that held this back from being a 5* rating was one of the last chapters, roughly 85-95% of the book I think. Cixin basically just dumps a shit-ton of exposition on the reader in that chapter and I didn't feel like it was packaged well enough to feel like it wasn't just an info-dump.

"2024 Update: I have watched most of various treatments of this work and my opinion stands. I still have no inclination to continue the trilogy.

I'm a simple man without a lot of complicated twists and turns. Look down my throat and you can see out my ass.

So says one of the undeveloped characters. He's hard-boiled like that. He's all Lemmy Constantine, though this dump isn't Alphaville--it's a protracted space invasion story, one with environmentalists as Fifth Columnists and an Ender's Game at its horrid core.

I read the book in a single day, which isn't a compliment given the 400 pages are eighty percent information dump. This is all explication. I kept waiting for swells of humanity, a soft curve to demonstrate that keeps us in the game instead I found To Serve Man by Lisbeth Salander. The plot unfolds revealing a gradual twist towards infamy. There's an exchange where a child ask about a monument to the Cultural Revolution and a battle between factions. The child asked about the buried, were they heroes? No. Were they enemies? No. What were they? History.

Don't expect half measures. That road to Hell is apparently paved by Rachel Carson and Pete Singer.

Throughout the virtual interludes one has a chance to channel Jared Diamond and ponder geographic determinism. I then saw how 21C China could appreciate this specific warning. I do not think it likely that I will pursue the trilogy though stranger things have happened. I have been pondering the speculative author Kameron Hurley all weekend and may approach her work in the near future.

"Una ida de olla, en pocas palabras.
Pero una ida de olla con una prosa absolutamente preciosa y poética a pesar de tener decenas de términos físicos complejos.
Las teorías, estudios y campos de la ciencia que abarca este libro están enfocados de una manera brillante y muy fiel a la realidad. Es cierto que se toma ciertas licencias para introducir la ciencia ficción pero no son del todo descabelladas, por lo que le da una dosis extra de realismo.
Sin duda me dispongo a seguir con el segundo de inmediato, porque a mí me ha fascinado a pesar de haber momentos en los que no entendía en qué contexto, escena o espacio me encontraba con los personajes.
No es una lectura para cualquiera ni para cualquier momento de tu vida, ya que es una ciencia ficción compleja y de esas que necesitas anotar y revisar términos si no dominas la física a un nivel usuario. Asequible, por supuesto, si estás dispuesto a aprender e investigar mientras lees :)

Hay tantos saltos en la trama que en ocasiones parece un ensayo completamente sacado de una tesis doctoral y en otros capítulos ahonda en las virtudes y defectos del ser humano, destacando, cómo no, su inteligencia.
Luego hay una subtrama que avanza en el tiempo de manera muy alternativa que parece un asunto policiaco o thriller.
También se tratan temas de guerras, política y acuerdos de paz.
Pero sin duda mi parte favorita es cuando habla del videojuego y de extraterrestres o seres de otros mundos.

"Physics doesn't exist.
A magnificent science fiction novel where the term 'scientific' truly holds meaning. Very briefly, I'll just highlight a few points.
The parallel history with the Cultural Revolution in China effectively emphasizes the fantastical element of the novel.
Some concepts truly boggle my mind, such as the Human Computer — a system where individuals serve as the equivalent of zeros and ones in computing.

I've been thinking that we, Earthlings, do live in paradise, with stable laws of physics and predominantly mild climates. However, we still haven't fully learned to appreciate it.

"I probably had too high of expectations coming into this book. It was on every sci-fi must read list I looked at and it swept the Nebula, Hugo, and World Fantasy awards. I was expecting it to be in my top 25 sci-fi books and I have to say - not even close. Yes, it's sweeping and yes it has some big ideas and yes there are moments of very vivid, imaginative story that I enjoyed. BUT, it felt to me like it was a collection of stories, verses a single novel, almost like it was written by several different people or at several different times. I understand it was translated from Chinese and that there are few successful Chinese hard sci-fi writers. But at times I found it a chore. I didn't hate it, but I was disappointed. The cover quotes the New York Times as saying it was a classic in the style of Arthur C. Clarke and I believe that setup an expectation for me that this novel could not overcome. Three Stars imo.

"This one starts pretty slow, but by the time the Three Body Problem is discovered and entered into, it becomes rather intriguing.

A fascinating Speculative book about humanity and how so many events and thought processes are connected.

If you have ever wondered what would happen if scientific changes were made to our planet or the sun, this book will be fun. As philosophers and later religious leaders try to predict future events on the earth, science shows that it will always be unpredictable to at least some extent. Will there be one sun? or 2 suns? Three suns? What happens, then? How long will today last? How long will night last? What can be sustained with extreme environmental changes? It feels like a Sim City/Civilization game with a twist.

I have a few unanswered questions, of course, but as this is the first book. I hope that those will be answered in later novels.

Political issues surrounding the author Liu Cixin/Cixin Liu or not, this book is well-written.

"“No, emptiness is not nothingness. Emptiness is a type of existence. You must use this existential emptiness to fill yourself.”


Note: do not read (or look) at the back of the book or the Goodreads synopsis.

The Three-Body Problem is a wonderful experience, set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution. This setting is new territory for me (besides knowing elements of the revolution). I knew little about China, so that backdrop was just intriguing. The only time I felt the need to do a google search was once (concerning the red coast guards) beyond that, I think Ken Liu (the translator) did a fantastic job to fill the cultural gaps.

I would advise not looking at anything plot related before reading it. It's interesting to see how much it spoils, almost to a ridiculous degree. I knew one element of the book before reading and thankfully that’s all. It didn’t harm the experience but avoiding plot details is advised. Seeing how the mystery unfolds is a part of the fun.



The plot was well done. There are some legitimate plot holes, however, it’s mostly consistent throughout. It serves its purpose of complementing the concepts Cixin Liu wanted to explore. One obvious concept he wanted to explore was The Three-Body Problem. How he constructs his plot to explore this idea might be the strongest element of the book. This book has many flaws, even for golden age sci-fi readers where its ideas-driven (for the most part). As stated, there are some plot contrivances and basic inconsistencies that you would think an editor would fix. So, at times very sloppy but the moments of genius are truly mind-blowing. The most praise I can give this novel is the sheer imagination. Liu Cixin had a vision and did his damnest to execute that vision. There are so many blowing set pieces that awe you and capture your imagination. It’s not for pure spectacle but in service of the author exploring certain themes.



Trauma, Scientific Discovery, Technology and The Cyclical Nature of History, are some of the central themes (alongside others). Trauma can be observed from the effects of the Cultural Revolution and its impact. With the theme of technology, he explores existentialism alongside it which was interesting. Cixin Liu uses his plot to talk about these themes and has these philosophical digressions throughout. There is plenty of interesting philosophical dialogue one in particular where the big action set pieces were in the backdrop while two characters are talking about their place in the universe after knowing certain news. It has those moments where you want to stop and contemplate.

Some elements of the book I thought delivered fantastically were the atmosphere, isolation and distance. Yang the main protagonist faces a lot of situations and one, in particular, got to me:

That sense of imprisonment, loneliness and feeling small, is where the book is at its best alongside some of the stuff I mentioned above.



As Cixin Liu is more influenced by golden age sci-fi akin to Asimov, so characters aren’t the focus. It does its job though admittingly a lot of the characters will blur in your mind. Da Shi was by far my favourite character, he had somewhat of a personality and was the most fun character. The second best would be Ye Wenjie then the main character Yang was fine. The remaining characters are pretty forgettable and obviously aren’t the point.



There are some unnecessary reactions to rightfully criticising the book. There’s this odd pretentiousness I’ve been observing, I will state my view on the most polarising element of the book which is these two elements. Firstly, I feel like I have to clear up some misconceptions about the golden age of sci-fi. Despite a lot of it being ideas-driven the prose was pretty good across the board. I feel like people might have checked out Asimov and assumed every writer from the age wrote in a dry manner (which is not the case). The dialogue in this era, I often didn’t feel was awful, some were very good it’s just the focus was often not the characters. Philip K Dick wrote some very good dialogue but are his characters the focus, well no. Just because your ideas-driven doesn’t negate solid-good dialogue.

Now, what are my thoughts on these two elements it was ultimately fine (with moments of beauty). I do think it leans towards the dry side and sometimes a bit too much. Though I do think there was an intentional reason why it was written in that manner. I’m just glad Da Shi exists as he gave some humanity to the dialogue. Another misconception that should be cleared up is that this writing style is also polarising in China. What bothered me the most was plot contrivances that make certain events feel artificial which was the most immersion-breaking aspect for me.



I’ve had some discussions about this topic I felt the need to address it. I don’t believe the book is inherently nihilistic. There are nihilistic undertones, however, at its core, I do not agree with that assertion. Without spoiling let’s just say I saw it overall from a more optimistic lens despite some dire situations that occurred.



In Conclusion, this is an ambitious novel that mostly succeeds at what it intends to execute. I loved the overall ending (last couple of chapters) and felt it was fitting. And I had a lot of fun reading it. The last remark is that read the author’s note, I think it’s extremely valuable and I’m grateful Ken Liu poured so much of his love into this translation. I overall would recommend reading this book, especially for the golden age and hard sci-fi fans.

"L’universo e la lotta di classe.

Ogni tanto la mia costanza viene premiata! Alludo all’ostinazione nel cercare ancora qualcosa di originale e meritevole in un genere che un tempo rappresentava una delle mie passioni (e da cui, per inciso, ho preso il nickname…) ma oggi mi pare sempre più in procinto di estinguersi nella ripetitività, dissanguato da mode narrative limitrofe come il fantasy, lo young adult o le saghe dei supereroi.

Viene premiata con un romanzo sorprendente come questo, non esente da difetti ma capace di mettere in campo una quantità di idee e geniali intuizioni come da tempo non capitava, una profusione di temi, anche a scapito dello stile e della costruzione dei personaggi, che punta decisamente e senza fronzoli a quello che in passato si identificava come il carattere precipuo della fantascienza: il cosiddetto “sense of wonder”.

Un senso del meraviglioso che, lungo le pagine di , ci trasporta senza tregua dentro ingannevoli e complessi videogames, storie realistiche della rivoluzione culturale maoista, estremismo ecologista, messaggi interstellari inquietanti nel significato e nell’interpretazione, diffusione di correnti politico-religioso-filosofiche che proliferano perché “.”

Anche se i lettori laureati con lode in fisica nucleare o ricercatori del Cern non saranno d’accordo, per quanto mi riguarda ciò che impedisce a questo romanzo di essere valutato come un indiscutibile capolavoro è soltanto l’eccesso ridondante di tecnicismi con pagine intere che spezzano il racconto e sembrano uscire, senza alcun filtro divulgativo, da un trattato di fisica teorica, nanotecnologia ed altre diavolerie similari. Cixin Liu, diplomato presso una prestigiosa università scientifica del suo paese, ne è talmente consapevole da proclamare nel poscritto .

Superato l’eccesso di disquisizioni ad alta tecnologia, resta comunque tanto: un mix affascinante e ricchissimo di illuminazioni e rivelazioni, un sapiente concentrato di sociologia, scienza, narrativa ed etica (forse con qualche pecca nel dosaggio degli ingredienti, come si diceva…), addirittura vertiginose situazioni da brivido, insomma un romanzo che a tratti può lasciare estenuati ma non certo indifferenti e che mi ha suscitato anche la curiosità di verificare se sia nata un’altra “New Wave”, con uno specifico approccio cinese alla narrativa fantascientifica (Liu Cixin non è l’unico ad essersi imposto di recente nel mercato occidentale), oppure si tratti “solo” del talento di un unico autore ispirato.

"Let's face it: If you strip away the interesting premise, the sophisticated physics and ignore the hype and the exotic author bonus Cixin Liu is given as a Chinese sci-fi writer you are left with nothing but:

* a crudely constructed and pretentious story
* one-dimensional characters steeped in ridiculous amounts of clichés that act like brain-amputated robots and have about as much human traits
* cringeworthy dialogues (tons of it)
* over-exposition at a level I have hardly ever read before
* a prime example of why trying to show but letting the characters tell is even worse than just telling in the first place.

Apart from all this I simply cannot wrap my head around the fact that given all his knowledge in the natural sciences and his attempts to portray them as realistically as possible in ""The Three-Body Problem"", Cixin Liu is obviously totally clueless about any theories concerning alien encounters and the almost impossible likelihood that these lifeforms may be anywhere close to humans. Not only in shape or form but also in terms of society, culture etc.

However his alien civilization is almost identical with the human one, having binary genders, a money system, a main city called Metropolis (yes, really - I ain't lying!) and a monarchical political structure. And Cixin Liu lets these poor alien fellas then blabber on about democracy, morality and empathy in order to drive his already terrible over-exposition home with a sledgehammer. Jeez...

Leaving the Fermi-paradoxon and the sorrounding theories aside (otherwise we would likely have no plot in terms of alien encounter at all), displaying your alien race in this manner is just utterly cringeworthy rubbish given how serious the book takes itself in the science department.

Long story short: Cixin Liu should have written a simple ""Physics for Dummies"" books instead of this massive trilogy because explaining physical phenomenas in a halfway decent and entertaining manner is actual the only thing he seems to be good at and care about.

"Una estupenda novela de ciencia ficción dura con el espíritu de la CF más clásica.

Una novela llena de ideas alucinantes y exquisito sentido de la maravilla.

Además tiene algo que me encanta, cuando una historia comienza de una manera y poco a poco se va transformando en otra cosa mucho más asombrosa y emocionante de lo que parecía (Como en Matrix, dichosos aquellos que fueron al cine en 1999 sin saber prácticamente nada de ella). Justo por esto les recomiendo leerla sin prácticamente leer ninguna reseña y sabiendo lo menos posible. Si tienen la suerte de desconocerla y no saber nada de la trama, no busquen información en ningún lado, consíganla y pónganse a leerla.

Lo bueno es que la contraportada de la edición en español se las arregla para no revelar nada, pero aguas con las versiones digitales, algunas nada más abrir el archivo te muestran una maldita sinopsis con spoilers terribles de la historia.

Por cierto, estoy completamente de acuerdo con estas palabras de la contraportada de la edición de NOVA: ""...esta obra maestra, enormemente visionaria, sobre el papel de la ciencia en nuestras sociedades, que nos ayuda a comprender el pasado y el futuro de China, pero también, leída en clave geopolítica, del mundo en que vivimos"".

Ahora acabo de leerla por tercera vez y vaya gozada (La leí por primera vez en diciembre de 2016 y luego de nuevo un par de años más tarde antes de comenzar con el segundo volumen El bosque oscuro).

Estoy disfrutando mucho la serie hecha en China por Tencent, dudo muchísimo que Netflix vaya a ser una adaptación tan buena. Ojalá lo compensen con excelentes efectos visuales y momentos llenos de emoción.

"Before I write anything else, I must talk about the Hugos. This novel, The Three Body Problem, won best novel in 2015, at the height of the Rabid and Sad Puppy shenanigans. In fact, The Three Body Problem didn’t even make the original finalists list; it was a replacement for an author who requested his work be removed, to avoid association with the Puppy movements.

Now the story of the Sad and Rabid Puppy movements is, to my mind, a tragedy, a woeful tale involving a Faustian bargain and corrupted good intentions. The two movements have become conflated, but they were quite different in the beginning. The Rabid Puppies name is not accidental. That movement was rooted in rabid alt-right conservatism. Which was and is and always will be garbage. The Sad Puppies movement, however, focused on the interesting question of what matters most in sci-fi and fantasy: the message or the adventure? The politics or the science? Skilled writing or diversity of perspective? Not that any of these are mutually exclusive, but it’s the rare gem that manages so many sparkling facets simultaneously. So, thought I, these are questions worth asking. However, in an omen of things to come, rabid extremists hijacked what might have been a meaningful conversation and turned it into an ideological, tribalist battle. Meh.

Regardless, at the time this Puppy issue occurred, I’d already begun to have my own doubts about whether the Hugos truly represented the “best” sci-fi and fantasy. Back in 2012, I’d read Blackout by Connie Willis, the 2011 winner of Best Novel. It is one of the worst books I’ve ever read. Flabbergasted by its Hugo win, I did some research and discovered that Connie Willis is a super nice human being, deeply enmeshed in the sci-fi community, and had quite a lot of name recognition as a two-time Hugo winner already. Ah, I thought with some disappointment, so the Hugos are just another popularity contest. Which, to be fair, is exactly what they are designed to be.

With that idea in my head, I read Ancillary Justice - which won the Hugo in 2014 and, in my opinion, deserved it. I then read the sequels Ancillary Sword and Ancillary Mercy, both of which were nominated, and both of which are terrible. I actually had to cut my one-star review of Ancillary Mercy by 70% because I went so far over Goodread’s character count. Insofar as it’s meaningful to describe a subjective experience as being objectively bad, Ancillary Mercy is an objectively bad book. This is no criticism of anyone who enjoyed it, but there's a giant gap, a critic's no man's land if you will, between subjective enjoyment and objective quality. Plot holes, abysmal characterization, minimal world-building, lack of tension, unrealistic depiction of humanity, small mindedness. Those are objective flaws, and Ancillary Justice's sequels has them all. Which, apparently, warranted Hugo nominations...? But again that is because the Hugos, as fan awards, do NOT denote objective quality, but subjective popularity.

So that is the mindset with which I approached the Three-body Problem: optimism tempered by a great deal of caution. I mean, I bought the book so I hoped it would be good, but, as a non-conformist who severely dislikes tribalism and its attendant mechanisms (e.g. mere exposure effect or the fallacy of vox populi), I no longer put much stock in a Hugo award.

A few hundred pages into Three-body Problem, I believed my fears were justified. I wrote: “I’m about halfway through and enjoying it. But nothing about this makes me think Hugo. Very basic science so far. Characters made out of cardboard. Glacial plotting. And the translation effect, if you will, gives the prose a stilted quality. Have the Hugo awards become less about storytelling and more about politics?”

But very soon after I wrote that, I encountered back-to-back chapters that turned the book around. The big ideas started rolling in. But before I get into those ideas, I want to talk about the book as a story.

Honestly, it’s not great. Starting off with some interesting Chinese history, involving the Cultural Revolution (and its devastating effects on scientists and other intellectuals), the book quickly proceeds into modern/near-future times. Here we are introduced to a shadow war, wherein some scientists are being targeted and murdered, or somehow forced to commit suicide. Connected with this conspiracy is a virtual reality game, called The Three Body Problem, about a group of aliens who live on a planet in a trinary system - that is, it has three stars. As you might imagine, this doesn’t exactly lend itself well to stable life. Giving much more would enter into spoiler territory, but it’s enough to say that this is a first contact story, and while the pacing was slow at times, I didn’t really have much issue with the actual plot.

The problem is the characters. They’re simply not good. With the exception of one scientist, there’s no character arc or journey to speak of. The PoV character is almost a complete blank. He’s there to observe, and nothing more. So if you require excellent characters in your sci-fi, Three-Body Problem likely will not satisfy.

That said, I *don’t* require excellent characters. I like them, I prefer my sci-fi to have them, but I appreciate that characterization is often sacrificed on the altar of science fiction's main concern: ideas. Unlike most other genres, which merely juggle character and plot, sci-fi isn’t sci-fi without some big ideas. As Ray Bradbury said, “science fiction is the fiction of ideas.” So while a sci-fi book can, in theory, do well at all three, the simple reality is that an author who spends a great deal of time studying philosophy and physics is not spending that time interacting with people. Or an author who spends his time writing poetry and honing his word craft is not spending that time studying AI, in order to better write about it.

So the characterization, not great. But what about the ideas? Well, as I said, I didn’t find much of worth in the first half, but as the plot started to offer some revelations, I perked up and got interested.

First, I want to talk about the actual mathematical three body problem, in particular about analytical vs numerical solutions. One of the major motivations in the virtual game, The Three Body Problem, is an attempt to solve the mathematical three body problem, which involves calculating the equations of motion for multiple bodies exerting a gravitational influence on each other. (And yeah the phrase 'three body problem' can be confusing. The math problem, the virtual reality game, and the actual book are all called The Three Body Problem).

To appreciate the difficulty of this problem, imagine you’re driving on an empty highway and you see a car headed toward you, driving on the wrong side of the road! Well naturally you don’t want to collide, so you move to the side of the highway the oncoming driver isn’t on. A two body problem, not that hard.

However suppose that in addition to a crazy driver coming at you, there’s also one travelling super fast, coming at you from behind! Well you don’t want to get hit by either one, so you try to dodge both. But they also don’t want to collide, so when you move aside, they see they’re headed straight toward each other and both move and now you’re back in the line of collision, so you move, but then they move, and OH MY GOD, WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE. You see how adding a third body can complexify what was a rather simple affair?

Where this becomes fascinating to me is that the three body problem doesn’t really have a (practically feasible) analytical solution: it has no specific, precise, 100% solvable solution. Unlike, say, the simple algebra equation x + 5 = 10, which can be solved ‘analytically.’ Instead, the three body problem must be solved ‘numerically’ via an algorithm (and probably a computer) to find an approximation, a close guess.

And you might be thinking, well, so what?

Well… the existence of physics problems which have no analytical solution - even in theory - has impressive metaphysical implications: Either (1) our mathematics is incomplete or broken in some way or (2) nature herself is non-deterministic. Or both, I suppose. While it might be tempting to say, obviously just #1... I wouldn't be so sure. And if you ponder Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, it seems that a 'complete' mathematics might well be impossible, which also has its own metaphysical ramifications. So this is an interesting topic to ponder. Three Body Problem doesn't delve into the gritty details, but it lurks at the edges, providing a nice subtle flavoring.

The next big topic, which Three Body Problem certainly does explore in great depth, is humanity's hatred of itself. Misanthropy isn’t particularly new. Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher who lived around 500 BC, was a famous misanthrope. He hated the common man because the common man didn’t seem to ever understand reality. But the notion that widespread misanthropy can have real consequences on human civilization IS new. With climate change a current existential threat, wide-spread misanthropy could mean the actual end of humanity.

And what about AI? I sometimes jest that I would be quite willing to betray humanity to our future robot overlords. But honestly... it's no jest. If I am ever confronted with such a choice, I might well help our future silicon children destroy us, if I believe they will be better caretakers of humanity's virtues and values.

Such is a core element of the Three-body Problem, both those who view aliens as a means to reform a failed humanity and the true misanthropes who view aliens as a means for destroying humanity altogether. As I wrote above, the existential threat of climate change demands we grapple with this question: At what cost is humanity worth saving? Right now, the cost willing to be paid is essentially nil. Apparently, no amount of convenience nor any amount of partisan politicking will be surrendered to increase the odds of humanity’s survival.

Another big idea, and equally core to the Three Body Problem, is the Quantum Mechanical conundrum known as the ‘measurement problem’ which in this book takes the form of what, exactly, our experiments are actually measuring - and whether these experiments might be interfered with by an outside force! However, I’m not going to write anything more about this, as such will be the major focus of the next review I’m writing.

There are other big ideas, of course, but I've run out of energy for writing about them and it's time to wrap this review up:

Science Fiction has its own sort of ""three body problem"": how to successfully solve the equations of characterization, plotting, and ideas (and you could add more, like prose or setting). Ironically, I think this book FAILS to solve that problem. Its characterization is simply bad, and while I have nothing but respect for the translator, I’ve never found translated prose to be equal to natural prose. Now, personally, I don’t think any book should be considered ‘best novel of the year’ unless it does manage to solve this ‘three body problem’ of sci-fi. HOWEVER, that’s a very high bar to set. Ultimately, I was quite satisfied with the Three Body Problem. I enjoyed it, and it made me think, and that’s what I want out of my sci-fi.

"Maaaaaan, this book...

So I received this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review and I really didn't know what it was all about. I'd never hear of 'the three body problem' and I've read very little SF up until now so it was certainly a new experience for me and took me a little while to truly get into, but I'd say it's thoroughly worth trying out.

Basically this is a great SF classic which is hugely loved over in China and has just been translated into English so that the Western World can also be exposed to the story and hopefully this will lead the way for other books from the East to also be translated.

When I began this story I was intrigued because the start of the story is very political-heavy and focuses a lot around the ideas of revolution and reform. I wasn't really sure where the sci-fi element was going to come into play, and I was a little confused at first by all of the different people and names. However, luckily this didn't last long and as I went through the storyline I noticed who was who and quickly found myself getting sucked deeper into the story.

This is an adult book for sure, not a dumbed-down version, and there's a lot of very technical explanation and happenings. I would never go so far as to call myself a scientist and therefore I know I didn't understand all of the complexities within this storyline, but I did really enjoy what I did understand and I felt that most everything was explained in a way that made it perfectly readable even if not fully comprehensible. The matter of the three bodies for example (three bodies i.e suns/stars/planets which surround a smaller body pulling it in various different gravitational directions) was one which I had previously no notion of and had never seen an example of but the explanation was simple and well thought out to allow anyone to understand it.

The storyline and characters were very interesting because a problem which I have previously found when reading SF is that the people within the story seem unapproachable and foreign. In this story I felt that the characters were all individual and they had a certain sense of genuine personalities to them which made me much more interested in the story and what was happening. There are two major character within this, the first Ye Wenjie, who is an astrophysicist. Early in the storyline she is a young woman but as the story progresses we follow aspects of her life and the things she gets up to throughout her adult years into her later years by the end of the story. She's a fairly well grounded character at first but as things develop through the story her resolve and dedication are questioned and she has to become a leader and fighter. She does some questionable things, but she does them for truly remarkable reasons and she thinks through her mistakes and plans in a very human way, making her seem like a likeable and believable character.

Then we have Wang Miao who is a Nanomaterials researcher who is again fairly down to Earth and a believable character. He becomes involved in a different storyline to Ye Wenjie and in his storyline we see that various Scientists around the world have started to commit suicide and we don't know why until Wang steps in (not entirely voluntarily) to see if he can find out a little more about it all. In his story we also get introduced to the 3body game which is a computer game. This computer game and the scenes focused in and around it were by far the most interesting parts of the story for me and really gripped my attention and the way that Wang sorts through all the possibilities and problems was cohesive and understandable which I very much appreciated.

The two storylines of these characters are intertwined in a variety of ways which gradually become clearer the closer to the end that you get and the story certainly builds up to a big climatic ending which makes you want to read on. I would say that if you like the idea of an adult-sci fi novel with links to Space, Particles, Video Games and more and you're willing to do some tough thinking at a few points whilst reading then I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this book. It's very well translated and doesn't feel at all forced, and overall I enjoyed the story, characters and ideas within it.

"Ίσως 3,5*

Παράξενο ήταν αυτό! Με την καλή έννοια!
Παρ' ότι είχα διαβάσει την περίληψη δεν μπορώ να πω ότι ήμουν προετοιμασμένη για το τι θα διάβαζα.
Στο μεγαλύτερο μέρος του βιβλίου δεν καταλάβαινα τι συνέβαινε. Μαζί με τον πρωταγωνιστή, κι εγώ, αναζητούσα απαντήσεις σε ερωτήσεις που όλο και συσσωρεύονταν.
Υπήρχε ένα μυστήριο γύρω από το θάνατο αρκετών διακεκριμένων επιστημόνων, μια μυστηριώδη κλειστή οργάνωση, ορισμένα ανεξήγητα, μεταφυσικά θα έλεγε κανείς, φαινόμενα και ένα παιχνίδι(;) εικονικής(;) πραγματικότητας.
Το σύμπαν τρεμοσβήνει και η αντίστροφη μέτρηση έχει ξεκινήσει. Ποιος γνωρίζει όμως τι θα συμβεί όταν φτάσει στο μηδέν;
Προς τα πού οδεύει ο ανθρώπινος πολιτισμός; Είναι δυνατόν να επιτευχθεί η σωτηρία της γης και ταυτόχρονα η σωτηρία της ανθρωπότητας; Ποιες οι ευθύνες του ανθρώπου ως μέλος του γήινου οικοσυστήματος;

Είχε ενδιαφέρον καθ' όλη τη διάρκεια του, αγωνία για την αποκάλυψη της αλήθειας και χωρίς να θέλω να αποκαλύψω πολλά, βρήκα τον κόσμο των τριών σωμάτων με τις Χαοτικές και τις Σταθερές Εποχές του ιδιαίτερα ευφάνταστο! Πολύ μου άρεσε αυτό!

Και τώρα ας περάσουμε σε κάποια όχι ακριβώς αρνητικά, πιο πολύ κάποιες παρατηρήσεις που έκανα και οφείλονται κυρίως σε προσωπικές προτιμήσεις.
Γενικά το βιβλίο επικεντρώνονταν περισσότερο στην πλοκή και στην ανάπτυξη των όποιων ιδεών και όχι τόσο χαρακτήρες τους οποίους βρήκα κάπως άχρωμους, δεν κατάφερε κάποιος να κεντρίσει το ενδιαφέρον μου.
Ενώ επίσης δεν ξέρω αν μου άρεσε πολύ ο τρόπος που επέλεξε ο συγγραφέας να μας δώσει τις απαντήσεις στις ερωτήσεις που συλλέγαμε στη διάρκεια του βιβλίου. Δόθηκαν μαζεμένες στο τέλος (σε ικανοποιητικό βαθμό!) με τη μορφή αφήγησης όπου αν και φυσικά και έβρισκα ενδιαφέρον, ήταν κάτι το οποίο έριχνε λίγο το ρυθμό. Πιστεύω πως ίσως θα μπορούσε να γίνει κάτι καλύτερο εκεί.

Σε άλλα νέα, έλεγε ώρες ώρες κάτι ωραία όπως “κοσμική μικροκυματική ακτινοβολία υποβάθρου” που με έκαναν πολύ να χαίρομαι που το διαβάζω στα ελληνικά!
Και εντάξει όταν άρχιζε τα πιο επιστημονικά λίγο το έχανα αλλά αυτό ήταν κάτι που δεν με ενοχλούσε απλά μερικές φορές (σαν άσχετη πάντα) μου φαίνονταν λίγο αναληθοφανή (βλέπε πχ σοφόνια). Τώρα θα μου πεις τι περίμενες, επιστημονική είναι. Εχ θα τ�� ήθελα ίσως λίγο πιο πειστικό.
(Τι κάθομαι και ψειρίζω κι εγώ τώρα...)

Κλείνοντας να πω πως οι εντυπώσεις που μου άφησε ήταν θετικότατες και νομίζω πως λειτουργεί εξαιρετικά ως εισαγωγή της τριλογίας, όπου για τα δύο εναπομείναντα οι προσδοκίες μου έχουν αυξηθεί και εκείνα ελπίζω να ανταποκριθούν!



Υ.Γ. Α και κάτι ακόμη! Το οποίο το βρίσκω και λίγο αστείο. Ο πρωταγωνιστής είχε την γυναίκα του ολίγον τι χεσμένη! Και η γυναίκα του εκείνον! Έφευγε από το σπίτι, το βράδυ δεν γυρνούσε, όταν γυρνούσε κλείνονταν στο γραφείο (δωμάτιο;) τέρμα αναστατωμένος κι αυτή ούτε μια ερώτηση! Κι αυτός τι γαϊδούρι! Δεν την σκεφτόταν ποτέ! Ένα τηλέφωνο να της πει είμαι ζωντανός μην ανησυχείς δεν την πήρε ποτέ!!

"This book is a science fiction masterpiece.

Before I delve into why it made my ""best-of-all"" books list, I need to disclose that this book is very hard sci-fi. That means that the science discussed here maybe very advanced for most to ""enjoy"" the story. The story the author tries to tell cannot be separated from the science of it for the majority, if at all..

With that out of the way, I shall tell you the 2 most outstanding things about this book.


I love physics, astronomy. I have loved them since I was a child. For many reasons I chose not to pursue a career out of it, a decision which pains me a bit everyday.
Bad decisions aside, all these years I have kept up with the string theories, the quest for a grand unified theory which tries to harmonise the laws of physics at the macro and the micro scale.
These things have and continue to fascinate me utterly and endlessly.

So when I happened upon this book, it felt like I was reading the voice of someone like me.
Someone hopelessly tied up in the wonders of the universe, unable to fully turn their eyes away from looking into the endless night of this ever expanding universe.
There is a beauty in science, maybe the most beautiful of them all.
Since it is a story of .

Needless to say this story fit right into the holes of my soul that still yearns for the path not taken.



Strangely, I have not read very many science fiction, to be honest.
Most(or all) of what I have, are stories from the English speaking world.

So when I picked up this book, and started consuming the story, I instantly knew I was reading something very very different.

One of the other books in my All-Time Favs is ""Kafka on the shore"" by Murakami. This was written originally in Japanese, and again you could tell when you read the translation that is not a conventional english book.

That is the beauty of translations, or translations well done.

I loved how even if I read this book in English, I knew without a shadow of doubt that this was not the language it was written in.
As a result, I felt a part of the Chinese culture. I felt I knew a bit more about them.
And this again just won my heart.



If you could not tell already, there is not one single thing that I would like to change in this book.
I feel that no amount of words of praise can wholly translate my feelings for this book.
This was my idea of .

"Kroz glavu su mi prolazila predavanja profesora Brane i rješavanje Lagrange - a, te pozicioniranje i štimanje diferencijalnih jednadžbi kako bi Lagrangeova točka bila što preciznije namještena. To jesam radio, ali sada mislim da ne bih znao. Bilo je zanimljivo koliko i teško, apstraktno i matematički furiozno i kompleksno. Radi se o vremenskim promjenama elipsoida... Kaos, i sve ovo je posloženo u ovu čudnu, čudnu, čudnu knjigu , koja je čak i kompleksnija od ovih jednadžbi pa je katkada bilo jako teško se probijati kroz nju.
Radnja se probija od komunističke Kine do invazije vanzemaljaca, te do ovisnosti o računalnoj igri koja pretpostavlja rješenja „Tri tijela“ na nevjerojatne načine.
Zbog svoje kompleksnosti, mnoštva situacija, i likova, meni, neobičnih imena, radnja se vuče kao puž i ostavlja nam otvoreni kraj gdje zaista čekam vidjeti što će se dogoditi kada odbrojavanje dođe do nule i kada na nas navrnu Triso¬laranci.
A sad oduševljenja: Ovakav stil nisam vidio nikada. Vrlo je matematički kompleksna, Hard SF kakav nisam čitao nikada. Razvoj likova i radnje se toliko razlikuje od Europskog ili Američkog načina pisanja romana da sam na trenutke šizio, oduševljavao se, gubio i bio sretan sve u istom osjećaju. Vjerojatno se radi i do fantastičnog prijevoda Ken Liua s Kineskog na engleski. Sumnjam da će netko skoro ovo prevesti na neki od domaćih jezika.
Poslastica je ovo koja je kod mene trajala jako dugo (5 mjeseci) pa mi je malo i na nos izašla i zaboravio sam neke dijelove, ali opet, ovo je jako dobar komad fantastike kojega bi trebao pročitati svatko tko voli hard sf i malo fizike.. e da: „Physics has never existed, and will never exist“, pa ti sad skontaj. :)

"эта книга, увы, не работает как «жёсткая» научная фантастика. я недостаточно хорошо разбираюсь в физике, но с точки зрения тех сфер, в которых я понимаю хоть что-то, в ней написано много чепухи — причём порой в несущественных мелочах. существо, в чьей культуре никогда не было литературы, не будет тосковать о её отсутствии. к изменениям, описанным в конце книги, герои привыкали бы не пару поколений, а пару лет — автор существенно недооценивает нашу адаптивность. и я уж не говорю о том, что чужеродные неведомые инопланетяне называют свою планету латинским словом, а проблема межрасовой коммуникации решается неким необъяснённым «универсальным кодом», который инопланетяне мгновенно расшифровали.

эта книга, увы, не работает и как метафорическая философская притча в духе Лема или Стругацких, потому что её мораль до оскомины банальна. да, репрессии — это плохо, а за экологией лучше следить, чем не следить. невероятный прорыв в гуманитарной мысли.

автор вызывает уважение тем, что посвятил целую книгу разбору и анализу одной физической проблемы. а ещё «Задача трёх тел» очень интригующе начинается — действительно ломаешь голову над тем, что за чертовщина творится.

но обоснование, увы, не поражает, а разочаровывает, и это только усугубляется тем, что все герои книги ведут себя весьма картонно.

две звёздочки — за чертовски интригующее начало.

P. S. возможно, я сильно ошибаюсь, но: чтобы решить задачу трёх тел, герои книги смоделировали её в виртуальном пространстве и запустили туда игроков, такой типа краудсорсинг. но разве для того, чтобы эту задачу можно было смоделировать (сделать физическую модель этих самых трёх тел), её не требовалось УЖЕ решить?

"Страхотна, космическа среща с научната фантастика, този път от китайски автор.

Това, което лично за мен беше най-завладяващо в “Трите тела”, е как Лиу Цъсин изследва различни измерения на чисто научните въпроси и събития. Несъмнено най-интересна, разбира се, е философската страна на случващото се. Тя се разкрива чрез редица въпроси, пред които човечеството неумолимо е изправено. Интересното е, че в тази история не започваме от тривиалното “Сами ли сме в тази Вселена?”, а от това... какво значение всъщност има това за нас, защо толкова ни вълнува? Дали ни води изначалният стремеж да бъдем откриватели на нови светове или пък сме загубили вяра в развитието на собствената си цивилизация? Дали търсим други форми на разум, за да сравним, опознаем и надмогнем собствената си непредвидима природа или тайно бихме предпочели да отдадем контрола върху нея на някого? Дали нашето собствено благополучие би било важно и ценно за някой друг, освен нас самите? Дали предстои залезът на човечеството и дали причините за него са заложени още при неговия изгрев? Необратимо ли е всичко това?

Тези въпроси маркират крехката връзка между човешкия микрокосмос и макрокосмоса, който обхваща всичко извън нас - близко и безкрайно далечно. И тъкмо тези въпроси изследва по свой начин всеки от героите в романа, но те са неминуемо отправени и към нас, читателите. И докато за нас това остава само в сферата на философските разсъждения, то за героите от “Трите тела” решението на тези въпроси ще предопредели бъдещето на цялото човечество. Какво ще бъде то - предстои да разберем в рамките на следващите две книги от тази завладяваща трилогия.

"It was quite a while since I read pure science-fiction. And now I remember why that genre is not my cup of tea. ""The Three-Body Problem"" is an ingenious creation: that the author presents us with a complete fantasy world is handsomely shielded by the solid rooting in historic reality (the story starts with a grim episode from the Chinese cultural revolution in the 1960’s) and by juggling with lots of scientific and technical terms and issues. Very occasionally a fascinating philosophical problem was raised (the real 'three-body problem is physical ànd philosophical issue), but then Cixin does nothing with it. The characters are as flat as can be and the story line after a while became downright boring. It will take some time before I dive into the future again; but happily the present and the past are complex and captivating enough!

"Would a large but secretive conspiracy use Email to let the conspirators know the address of the location that its next meeting is at? This is an important question. No they would not, not even when this was written 25 odd years back.

Would an alien civilisation know what a bull’s eye is? Did they have Walnuts? Just two less than profound and meaningless questions, I suppose. This was the reason I moved away from Sci Fi in my early 20’s to rarely come back. That feeling that it dated rapidly. When aliens were involved my then youthful imagination was fast dissipating into a demand for some historical form of what was reality and history became the normal read.

As to Sci Fi, interestingly I have just recently finished a couple of Kurt Vonnegut’s very dated Sci Fi’s, the difference between him and books such as this was (and not noted in my youth) he was actually making a comment about the human condition using Sci Fi as a trope. The Three Body Problem is purer in the scientific approach and that is where they can fall down rapidly with time I suppose. Things get dated, Email for example.

As to the writing and/or translation, considering how conceptually very good this piece of Sci Fi is, there is an at times clumsiness in the telling of what is essentially a first contact story. The characters can be a dull or even clichéd. Policeman Shi Qiang is one of the most clichéd characters I have read in any form of literature. I also note that this is going to be a TV series soon, and adapted for an English-speaking audience. It almost felt like a film script at times.

Anyway onwards and upwards and as the blurb says “Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilisation on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion.” I suppose it the clever mix of Cultural Revolution revenge politics and the consequences make this conceptually very interesting.

Being the first of a trilogy I naturally want to know ‘what happened next’ so with that thought in mind I will listen via my Audiobook allowance via Spotify in a couple of months’ time.

"Nu m-am putut abține și am trișat: am terminat cartea înainte de „termen”, după ce ajunsesem la 7 dimineața într-un moment pe care doar termenul „mindfuck” îl poate descrie.

The Three-Body Problem este unul dintre cele mai interesante romane SF pe care le-am citit. A fost copleșitor. O să recitesc o parte din capitole, pentru că au fost mult prea frumoase și intense ca să fie uitate. Nu mi-am dat seama cât de mult mi-a lipsit SF-ul, acel „amestec” de fizică și politică, presărat în cazul de față cu astronomie, economie și istorie.

Nu e o lectură ușoară, e o operă de savurat.
Mi-au plăcut la nebunie incursiunile din joc, „rezolvările” propuse, deși a trebuit să le recitesc, ca să fiu sigură că le-am înțeles.
Iar personajele... nici nu știu de unde să încep cu ele. M-au fascinat, m-au revoltat și m-au înspăimântat alegerile lor, precum și sentimentele care le-au controlat acțiunile. Mintea umană rămâne una dintre cele mai periculoase enigme din prezent.

În urmă cu câteva luni, spuneam că nu pot să mă uit la cer fără să mă gândesc la Magonia. Acum nu voi putea să mă uit la cer, la stele, la soare, fără să mă gândesc la The Three-Body Problem.

P.S.: Au fost câteva momente în care romanul m-a făcut să mă simt ca o incultă.

In my mind, the first “emptiness” I created was the infinity of space. There was nothing in it, not even light. But soon I knew that this empty universe could not make me feel peace. Instead, it filled me with a nameless anxiety, like a drowning man wanting to grab on to anything at hand.

"3,5 estrellas
Me cuesta mucho reseñar este libro, la impresión que tengo es que tendría que volverlo a leer porque intuyo que tiene mucho más valor del que yo he captado como lectora. O quizá tendría que leer la continuación de la trilogía antes de emitir una opinión fundada.

Comenzando por lo positivo, me ha gustado el entorno poco habitual en novelas de ciencia ficción - el inicio de los personajes en la época de la Revolución Cultural china y cómo la ciencia se desarrolla en el marco político que ofrece el país en la actualidad. Creo que también hay un sentido de lo maravilloso, una grandeza - enormidad - en las preguntas que plantea; por ejemplo, si a la humanidad realmente le interesa encontrar vida extraterrestre.

También hay una parte de intriga detectivesca - la investigación de los suicidios de importantes científicos, que da amenidad a la trama y la acerca al thriller.

Lo que más me ha costado ha sido toda la parte de ciencia ficción hard - creo que me he perdido totalmente, seguramente porque no he sido capaz de prestar demasiada atención. El tema del videojuego me ha superado, aunque tengo la impresión de que contiene ideas muy interesantes.

Los personajes, como me sucede a veces con la literatura asiática, son un poco herméticos y no es fácil empatizar con sus comportamientos.

En fin, que es una obra diferente a todo lo anterior y que seguro entusiasmará a los aficionados a la ciencia ficción hard.

"Qué belleza este libro. Lo primero que siento al rememorar la experiencia de lectura es el movimiento de la narración: tiene una cadencia tan diferente de los típicos relatos de ciencia ficción (género de alta impronta estadounidense). Aquí sabes que no estás leyendo una de esas. Aquí sientes que el tiempo toma otro ritmo, porque sus personajes transitan la obra como si fluyeran en la corriente de una historia inevitable.
Es interesante ver que las personas no tienen los roles protagónicos. Antes bien, puede darse ese lugar a ciertas ideas filosoficas y debates epistemológicos.
La reflexión sobre la ciencia es un eje claro. Está dentro del juego que da nombre a la obra, pero también está afuera ""en el mundo real"". El libro admira y cuestiona sucesivamente lo que la ciencia y la tecnología aportan a la humanidad.
De los personajes, debo admitir que me costó darles seguimiento por los nombres chinos, se me confundían y tuve que recurrir a la guía que trae en las primeras páginas. La historia abarca largos períodos de tiempo y reconstruir los vínculos e historias personales me obligó a hacer una lectura más pausada.

Me gustó mucho.

"Fascinant și exotic, dar rece. Așa aș descrie pe scurt romanul. Ideile sunt faine, motivațiile personajelor sunt de un extremism științifico-naiv care m-a fascinat, părțile științifice sunt destul de plăcut inserate în roman.

Am avut o problemă cu numele unora dintre personaje, nu neapărat pentru că n-am reușit să le deosebesc timp de câteva zeci de pagini, ci pentru că unele mi s-au părut amuzante (și apoi m-am cam urât că râd de niște nume străine). Totuși, tonul romanului mi s-a părut cumva rece, distant. N-aș ști să spun de ce, dar nu mi-a displăcut, ci mi s-a părut ceva nou.

A început să-mi placă să citesc autori din afara zonei anglo-saxone pentru că diferențele sunt sesizabile și, uneori, e fain să descoperi culturi și stiluri noi. Așa că recomand cartea iubitorilor de SF care nu se tem să încerce lucruri noi :)

"Ciencia Ficción (Muy Buena Ciencia Ficción, definitivamente) con una clara crítica social, escrito con eficacia y contundencia. Y aunque el foco no esté puesto en el desarrollo de los personajes, sale un detective que merecería una novela para él solito. Además, cada vez que leía ""Fronteras de la Ciencia"" me acordaba del sketch de Les Luthiers y no me lo podía tomar en serio. Pero, por lo demás, todo más que bien.
La historia es intrincada eso sí, por momentos francamente desorientadora y requiere concentración y una mínima comprensión de temas científicos, pero vale la pena. Decir más es arruinar una historia original y valiosa.

No me esperaba para nada esta historia. Después de escuchar a tanta gente decir que era una obra súper densa y muy difícil, me imaginé una especie de ""Mars Attacks!"" llena de palabras y conceptos incomprensibles, a menos que tuvieras un doctorado en física y astronomía. Cierto es que hay partes más técnicas, pero para nada hace que la lectura sea incomprensible o sea un obstáculo.

He disfrutado muchísimo esta obra; ha sido un vicio durante estos días y he cogido muchísimo cariño a varios personajes. Como siempre, amo a los personajes grises, y en este caso, Da Shi me ha robado el corazón.

No puedo imaginar qué va a suceder en el siguiente libro, pero tengo muchísimas ganas de saber qué nos depara esta historia.

The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin is the most thought provoking piece of science fiction that I have read since I read the amazing The Clockwork Rocket by Greg Egan. This is an amazing literary work as well as it is a science fiction novel. It should have a huge audience as it does not lecture, or talk down to the reader. The story is bold and fun and very relative to our modern day world. It is unbelievable that this is a translated work as it is simply marvelous. Liu Ken really did an amazing job at making the translation feel invisible.


The Three-Body Problem is at it’s heart a science fiction thriller that spans more than 40 years of time. It is fast paced and a real page turner. It also has a few twists to keep things interesting. This however is not what makes this book special. It is the subject matter and the story itself that make The Three-Body Problem a must read for science fiction lovers as well as those that love literary fiction.


Deep subjects covered:

Physics;



““It means that the laws of physics are not invariant across time and space.””




“Can the fundamental nature of matter really be lawlessness? Can the stability and order of the world be but a temporary dynamic equilibrium achieved in a corner of the universe, a short-lived eddy in a chaotic current?”




““It depends on the number of dimensions of your observation perspective. From a one-dimensional perspective, it’s only a point—that’s how ordinary people think of the particles. From a two- or three-dimensional perspective, the particle begins to show internal structure. From a four-dimensional perspective, a fundamental particle is an immense world.”
The princeps said, “To use a word like ‘immense’ to describe a subatomic particle such as a proton seems incredible to me.”
The science consul ignored the princeps and continued, “As we move to higher dimensions, the complexity and number of structures within a particle increase dramatically. The comparisons I’m about to make will not be precise, but should give you an idea of the scale. A particle seen from a seven-dimensional perspective has a complexity comparable to our Trisolaran stellar system in three dimensions. From an eight-dimensional perspective, a particle is a vast presence like the Milky Way. When the perspective has been raised to nine dimensions, a fundamental particle’s internal structures and complexity are equal to the whole universe. As for even higher dimensions, our physicists haven’t been able to explore them, so we cannot yet imagine the degree of complexity.””



Good vs Evil;



“As she continued to mull over these thoughts, a deduction made her shudder: Is it possible that the relationship between humanity and evil is similar to the relationship between the ocean and an iceberg floating on its surface? Both the ocean and the iceberg are made of the same material. That the iceberg seems separate is only because it is in a different form. In reality, it is but a part of the vast ocean.…”



Human Nature;




“There’s a strange contradiction revealed by the naïveté and kindness demonstrated by humanity when faced with the universe: On Earth, humankind can step onto another continent, and without a thought, destroy the kindred civilizations found there through warfare and disease. But when they gaze up at the stars, they turn sentimental and believe that if extraterrestrial intelligences exist, they must be civilizations bound by universal, noble, moral constraints, as if cherishing and loving different forms of life are parts of a self-evident universal code of conduct.”



The Three-Body Problem is an amazing and unforgettable read that ends with a bang. I loved everything about it and cannot wait for more. A must read!!!!

"Il problema dei tre corpi? Beh, quello lo spiega l'autore nel romanzo. Ma io, facendo il verso al libro vi dirò, invece, che a mio parere il problema de Il problema dei tre corpi è....che è noioso.

Ovviamente è un mio parere. Mi dispiace, Cixin, sarò una voce fuori dal coro ma il tuo libro proprio non mi è piaciuto. 2stelle e tanta stima verso le idee davvero interessanti e il tentativo di portarle avanti nel libro con rigore scientifico (tentativo non sempre riuscito, a dire il vero). Ti ringrazio, Cixin, inoltre per avermi fatto assaporare una parte della storia cinese (la cruenta rivoluzione culturale e il post rivoluzione) che mi è totalmente sconosciuta. Ma davvero oltre a queste 2 stelle non riesco ad andare. Perché mi sono trascinato per tutto il volume senza appassionarmi a nulla di quel che accadeva ne provare slanci emotivi di alcun genere verso chicchessia nel libro. D'altronde parliamo di personaggi piatti o improbabili, la cui caratterizzazione è spesso proposta al lettore con infodump e storie o aneddoti piazzati nei momenti più inopportuni, in conversazioni spesso goffe o inverosimili. Addirittura nei capitoli 32 e 33 il macchiettoso e l'assurdo raggiungono livelli sorprendenti, roba da lanciare il volume fuori dalla finestra (mi sono ritrovato, in questi 2 capitoli, quasi a chiedermi se per caso non stessi leggendo uno dei capitoli sarcastici/dissacranti di Douglas Adams...invece Cixin era serio). Insomma, per me leggere questo libro è stato un travaglio. Devo ringraziare che la lunghezza sia di sole 370pg, perlomeno ne sono venuto a capo, in un modo o nell'altro.

Un cambio di marcia nella fantascienza, dicono di questo libro. Io preferisco il passo dei vari Asimov, Simmons, Robinson. Questo ciclo lo lascio volentieri agli scienziatoni che cercano il cambio di passo e teorie fantascientifiche rivoluzionarie. Io cercavo un romanzo e questo romanzo non ha toccato le corde che speravo. Non mi ha stimolato interesse alcuno e men che meno ne provo ora nel chiedermi come proseguirà la storia.

"Full of fascinating things and big ideas, I really liked this book but didn't connect deeply with its characters.

It all got slightly jumbled in my mind, and in the beginning, I kept getting characters mixed up - probably because I listened to the audiobook instead of eye-reading this, which I wouldn't recommend in this case. I loved the super weird alien world and civilization - which we don't actually get to see directly yet, it's always filtered through human imagination and interpretation, e.g. turning it into a VR game.

I also loved the parallels in how some scientists on both the human and the alien side sympathized more with the other than with their own species, romanticizing the other and projecting the solution to all problems onto them. I also really enjoyed the backstory of the cultural revolution and everyone trying to tow the line of political correctness.

That said: the characters sometimes seemed a bit odd and hard for me to understand in some of their actions. I also didn't really like the portrayal of the secret society, which seemed to do way too little grooming and convincing, instead people just seemed to jump onto the bandwagon for reasons that didn't fully convince me. Don't go in here expecting fantastic character studies - it's more a study of a particular characteristic (that of preferring ""the other"" to ""one's own"", and the way trauma can make you cold and unfeeling towards your fellow men) manifesting in various characters in different ways.

I think mostly, it's a novel about the beauty (and dangers) of science and written by someone who really loves science himself. There were also some beautiful metaphors, it had a vast scope (on the alien side) while being very down-to-earth (on the human side). I wouldn't categorize it as a literary masterwork, but it was very interesting and I'm looking forward to continuing the series.

"Трите тела е най-интересното, което съм чел последните няколко години и затова тази година си я препрочетох в маратон за цялата поредица.

Първата книга ни разкрива Трителия, а всъщност дали не ни разкрива и повече за самата Земя? Самият факт, че поради естеството на земляните, част от несъгласните си организират Земно Трително Движение показва готовността ни да се припознаем с друга култура, дори с друг свят, веднъж неприпознавайки ценностите в своя собствен. Да приемем неземляните за Богове. Страшно заключение от автора и поради това си мисля - твърде вярно.

Дали накрая ще се окажем просто едни ""буболечки"" в широкия космос? Няма да разкривам повече по сюжета, а той действително е запленителен. Неслучайно е международното признание за автора и точно тази трилогия и точно тази първа книга - тя, първата е универсална за Земята, а следващите са универсални в смисъл на вселенски.

Изпъкват задълбочните познания / проучвания на автора в научната сфера, най-вече астро-физика, но и редица други дисциплини, почти всичките в авангарда на днешната наука. Няма как, за сериозна Sci-Fi, си трябва сериозна наука. Същото важи и за да имаш невероятна китайска книга на български - ти трябва Стефан Русинов.
Читателски поклон пред автор и преводач, както и целия екип, който стои зад проекта на трите книги. Подарихте ми страхотни мигове и мисли!

"A series of scientifically impossible events leads to the discovery of an imminent alien invasion in this translation of the insanely popular and award winning Chinese novel.

This novel has pretty much everything a sci-fi fan could ever want - epic scale, high octane action and suspense, mind blowing hard sci-fi concepts. The prose leans heavily on dramatic metaphors and crisp, stark imagery in a way that might be a little jarring at first for readers not used to such a direct style, but once you train your mind to accept it, it makes for quite a memorable experience.

From it's shocking opening condemning the maoist revolutionaries' war on science - horrific circumstances that lead directly to human collaboration with the impending invasion force - all the way through to the climactic discovery of the seemingly insurmountable advantage the invaders have, this book is as close to un-put-downable as you are likely to find.

I cannot recommend a book more highly than this and anticipation for its soon to be released sequel grows more painful by the day.

"Страхотно начало! Разбирам защо целия свят е луднал по тази трилогия. Земното минало на Лиу Цъсин се превърна в сензация на световната и българската литературна сцена. В основата на първата книга от трилогията за Земното минало на Лиу Цъсин ""Трите тела"" лежи подре познатия мотив за извънземна инвазия. Редица необясними явления предизвикват смут в научните среди и карат човечеството да постави под съмнение устоите на фундаменталните науки. Най-изтъкнатите учени в света, започват да се съмняват в логиката и научната стойност на натрупаните с векове знания, най-вече в областта на физиката. Събитията довеждат до лудост някои учени, което предизвиква убийства и самоубийства на изтъкнати имена в научните среди.

Уан Мяо работи в областта на нанотехнологиите. Изследванията, които ръководи са в много напреднал стадий и изглежда се намира на крачка от постигането на успех, когато животът му се преобръща. Ученият е поканен на тайна военна среща, в която макар и по-голямата част от информацията да е засекретена, едно става кристално ясно, извънземна заплаха е надвиснала над Земята. Малко след тази среща, Уан Мяо започва да получава заплахи да прекрати нанотехнологичния си проект и необясними явления започват да се случва с и около него. Всичко това го кара да се замисли дали не е загубил ума си. В този преломен момент Уан Мяо открива виртуалния свят на играта ""Трите тела"". На пръв поглед играта изглежда хаотична и непредвидима. Но сякаш зад фасадата на този измислен свят се крие ключа към обяснението на цялата лудост обзела света.

В света на Трите тела, климатът и метеорологичните промени не могат да бъдат предвидени, което пречи на цивилизацията да планира своите краткосрочни и дългосрочни нужди. Това означава, че е невъзможно да бъде изградена трайна защита срещи непредвидимите климатични промени, това спира по-нататъшното развитие и съществуване на всички форми на живот.


Паралелно със съвременната и виртуалната сюжетни линии, повествованието се връща и години назад по време на Културната революция в Китай, защото именно там и тогава започва всичко. Как и защо не мога да ви кажа, защото, първо, концептуално книгата е твърде многопластова и географски и хронологично динамична, за да бъде синтезирана в един кратък текст. Второ, това ще спойлне твърде много. Културната революция в Китай трае десет години, последиците от нея - много по-дълго. В тези десет години Китай издига на пиедестал к��мунизмът и изкоренява с пълната бруталност, жестокост и безкомпромисност, на която е способен, всяка треска, която посмее да щръкне от гладките идеали на Партията. Кървавите сблъсъци и сляпата жестокост са отразени много натурално още в първите страници на книгата.

Много силно начало поставя Лиу Цъсин в ""Трите тела"". Следваща спирка от ""Земното минало"" - ""Тъмна гора""

"4.5 stars, rounded down.

I will admit with zero shame that this book’s reputation intimidated me a little bit at first. Hard sci-fi often feels very dry and dense and add to that the possibility of nuances and references being lost in translation made me weary. But I really shouldn’t have worried (or maybe I just shouldn’t underestimate myself): I was sucked into the story very quickly, and plowed through the book much faster than I had anticipated (also, I was being pressured by a friend who really wanted me to read it, so I could watch the Netflix show, so we could talk about it).

Weaving together the storyline of a young scientist caught in the upheaval of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the current day mystery of scientists haunted by strange countdowns and a hyper-sophisticated virtual reality game, ‘The Three-Body Problem’ manages to strike a rare balance between soft and hard sci-fi, by giving the reader plenty of (remarkably clearly explained) science to chew on, as well as the very human impact of first encounters.

While the book and the series are quite different, they are both equally enjoyable, in wildly different ways. But they both orbit around (see what I did there?) the issue of whether or not the characters think humanity can redeem itself – or if we have, as a species, slipped beyond redemption. Different characters have very different views on that extremely complex question, and their experiences and hopes guide them through events they could never have imagined.

I really appreciate the way in which Cixin Liu manages to make the science-y parts of ‘The Three-Body Problem’ precise and interesting without ever slipping into ponderous info-dumping: there are many elements of this story that require some understanding of physics, astrophysics, mathematics and programming, but you don’t need to be an expert in any of those fields to follow the plot. The information is given at the right time and in perfectly dosed quantities, so no reader gets lost trying to figure out why those details matter. I also really appreciate the bits about the Cultural Revolution, and how none of it was sugar-coated. This is not a period of history we learn a lot about in the public education curriculum in the West, so I had very limited knowledge about it when I started reading and I learnt a lot. While the device of the video game felt a little odd at first, that too was skillfully worked into a very engaging narrative tread – and all those things are very ingeniously brought together in a way that blew my socks right off.

The only reason this book lost a half-star is that I struggled a bit to connect with any of the characters, which is really where I usually have issues with hard sci-fi. They simply don’t feel quite as well developed as they should be; I wanted more of their inner lives, and while their motivations are usually quite clear, a little nuance would have made them more human (the series has a different but similar problem, where it has too many dang characters who sometimes behave not at all the way scientists would – I blame this on the current trend of making every single tv show into an ensemble cast thing)

I highly recommend the book and the series as long as you keep in mind that they split and explore the premise of the story differently after a certain point. I look forward to the second book and the second season!

"4.5 stars. Liu's take on an alien invasion on Earth is a beautiful and poignant picture of science and its philosophies, and human relationships. It poses some thought provoking questions about the infallibility of science, and through that, you realise that we rely on science to tell us all the right answers, all the time, and when it fails, it's terrifying. The mystical and elusive game, 3-body, that ties in to the main plot, invites the player - and reader - to solve the 3-body problem in physics. It's intention is to demonstrate that science could not, as of now.

If you, like me, tend to avoid translated books or books written by authors whose first language isn't English (not because they aren't good, but because of clumsy language - which again, isn't any fault of the author's), you should give The Three-Body Problem a go. I'm going to talk a bit about this because I really appreciated the translation. In the translator's note, Ken Liu wrote that he intentionally retained some phrases or sentences that were more 'directly' translated from Chinese, such as phrases that are heavy in cultural references, or puns, or word play in Chinese, because he wanted readers to gain insight into the way a different culture express ideas. This is as opposed to a good chunk of the book, which was completely translated into English, such that the original structure and grammar of the Chinese phrasing is gone.

While I admit that a lot of the book sounds clunky because of the translation, it is also rich in the Chinese culture, which I appreciate greatly. I have not read Chinese novels in a while (my Mandarin is atrocious) so I love that I can enjoy Chinese lit in English. How ironic, considering that The Cultural Revolution plays a big part in the story, and I am essentially a Western Imperialist.

The Three-Body Problem actually made me doubt my confidence in the truth of science and logic, and to rethink my beliefs about the universe. I will definitely get my hands on the second installment as fast as I possibly can.

Edit: I referred to while writing this review because I wanted to understand how much the translator had to do for this novel. It covers a few key differences between the English and Chinese language, for example, that the English uses more abstract vocab for expression, and the Chinese uses concrete vocab for abstract ideas. This is very prominent throughout the whole book. Very interesting and it made me appreciate the translation a lot more.

"Executive Summary: Easy to see why this is up for awards, very enjoyable.

Audio book: Luke Daniels! He's awesome. Maybe not the best fit for this book, but I'd take him over just about anyone for audio books. I hope he'll be narrating the rest of the series.


This is a hard one for me to review. I generally don't like Hard Sci-Fi too much. I read for pleasure, and I do enough thinking at work. I don't really need to spend my free time thinking hard.

That said, I didn't find the science too overwhelming, except maybe at the end where there was a huge infodump about folding protons. I think if you are a fan of hard sci-fi, you may love this book, where I just found it pretty enjoyable.

The story pulled me in slowly. I wasn't really sure what the prologue had to do with anything until maybe halfway? Possibly later. I have a hard time with names in general, especially in audio, so this was no different, but it was easy enough to keep the characters straight. There isn't a ton of POVs to deal with at least. I think my favorite is probably the no brain/mouth filter cop. His dialogue always made for some fun parts.

My favorite part is probably the Three Body ""game"". This is what finally pulled me completely. I'm fairly confident I would have quit it quite early on, but it's interesting to read about someone obviously far smarter than myself take on the challenge.

I really had no idea what this book was going to be about, and I can't say I really saw where it ended up coming, but it wasn't a total surprise either.

The Chinese setting makes for a breath of fresh air. If there is stuff this good coming out of China, I hope more of it gets translated soon. It seems as though Ken Liu does an excellent job with it.

Overall, I think an enjoyable read, and I'm looking forward to picking up the second one when the audiobook gets released.

I have a rule that I won’t rate a book I have not read at least 50% of. Well I am at the 52% mark with this one and am throwing in the towel. Hard SF is just not for me.

It started off so strong with the descriptions of the Cultural Revolution and how Chinese scientists were mistreated in the process. Initially I did not mind the very dry writing style however as the story progressed it started feeling more like a boring lecture than an actual story.

Take for example:



Or this one:



I think there IS a good story somewhere hidden between all the masses of textbook science, but I just don’t have the interest or patience to find it. I understand that this story is more complex than just the run of the mill Aliens Are Coming but did it have to be so dry?

If you are interested in questions of philosophy and physics without the need for connecting with strong characters to carry a plot, then perhaps you may find this worthwhile.

"Rating 4* out of 5. This was strange. The otherworldly feel came mostly from the fact that the book starts with events during the Chinese cultural revolution and subsequent events also relate deeply to this. Almost all other science fiction I have read has been written by a North American or European author and the perspective thus decidedly Western. ""The Three-Body Problem"" felt alien from start to finish because of its deep Eastern roots.

Sure I had some idea of where things were headed, but most of the events in this book took me by surprise. It was a refreshingly unique read as such, not re-wrapping of old familiar elements.

Ye Wenjie, one of the main characters, watches her father being killed during the Cultural Revolution. She herself quickly becomes a suspect element, but is recruited to scientific research. Many years later, nanotech engineer Wang Miao is told to infiltrate the organization that Ye Wenjie has worked with. He becomes involved in a strange computer game dealing with a civilization trying to survive on a planet with three suns. Wang also experiences a strange count-down and is desperate to find out how everything is connected.

I am left somewhat perplexed because not all elements of this book were easy to follow. The basic plot line is easy enough to grasp and fascinating, but it is interspersed with scientifc jargon which goes way beyond my understanding. I have no idea if it's mere BS or not. Anyway, doomsday is coming. I think there is more in the series and it will definitely be worth exploring.

"As other reviews mention, this is definitely a science fiction book that is chock-full of fascinating ideas. Some parts are quite engaging; the descriptions of tri-solaris, a world where three suns follow unpredictable orbits, with chaotic consequences for the inhabitants. Some of the episodes of the virtual reality game are simply great, like the computer that Von Neumann attempted to use to predict the trajectories of the suns; he built with 30 million soldiers, organized into and, or, nand, and exclusive or gates! And the idea that people there are dehydrated during the chaotic periods, and later rehydrated during regular periods is quite a fantastic idea.

But I had some mixed feelings about the book. Some parts of the narrative are dry and even lose coherence. The narrative seems to skip around, and some of the big events occur in a few sentences without any lead-in to help the reader understand the background. Perhaps if I were more familiar with Chinese politics and history it would have made more sense.

I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Luke Daniels. He is a good reader. He used a number of different accents--totally ad hoc, since the action all takes place in China and various English accents don't quite fit--but what else could he do, since the book is a translation? Occasionally I had trouble figuring out who was speaking in the dialogs, but for the most part the narration was clear.

"Overall I would rate this 3.5 stars. There were parts of this book that I really enjoyed, and other parts that I did not. Some parts were a bit overly technical for my taste, and some just a little confusing. About halfway through the book, I started to enjoy the story much more. Up until that point I was thinking that I wouldn't pursue this trilogy past book one, but now I might read the second book.

One thing I enjoyed overall was that fact that it was a story written from another cultural perspective really did come through. The best way to describe it is that even though I was reading in English, I felt like I could hear and see the characters in Chinese - probably it helps that I watch quite a few foreign films too. In the translator's notes at the end, Ken Liu notes that a good translation shouldn't read as if it was originally written in English, but should capture some of the cadences of the original language. I think he was successful in achieving that. Having said that, I know that there is a different translator for book two, so I am somewhat interested in reading the second book to see both the outcome of the story and also out of interest in how it will read differently because of that.

"I don't read a lot of sci-fi, not because I dislike the genre but because I want my sci-fi reading to come in, blow my mind, and then mosey back out. And if that's what you like, The Three-Body Problem is an excellent example. I like sci-fi that is unlike anything else I've read before, that tries new things, and examines new possibilities, and finds the human stories within its world. We're very lucky that Liu's trilogy is being translated (the 2nd is coming out soon) because this is right up there with any sci-fi I can remember reading in the last several years.

If you're one of those people who finds science-fiction lacks a sufficient amount of science, you'd best get this book in your hands IMMEDIATELY. The physics here is no joke, from multiple dimensions to nanotechnology to virtual reality to interstellar travel, it's all here and it seems pretty legit to me. (I do have a BS in Biochemistry and several college-level physics classes to back me up, so I'm not an expert but nothing to sneeze at.) Add to that the Chinese Cultural Revolution and there's just nothing to compare this book to. This is ""hard"" sci-fi in the best way, and even if you're not exactly sure what all of it means, you can't deny how awesome it is.

"Бой се от ахейците, дори когато идват от бъдещето: http://knigolandia.info/book-review/t...

“Трите тела” е началото на мащабна трилогия за сблъсъка на човешки с извънземен разум. Лиу Цъсин използва един чудесен подход, който работи прекрасно и в “Играта на Ендър” на Орсън Скот Кард – вгражда виртуална реалност сред сюжета си, която под формата на игра всъщност го задълбочава и доближава до истината. В тази реалност играчът попада на странен свят с непредсказуем климат, който не позволява плавното развитие на цивилизация. В поредица от опити тайната на този свят започва да се разкрива, а Цъсин си играе с въображението, включително като изпраща знакови учени да създадат жив компютър, използвайки… безброй китайски войници с флагчета в ръце. Там, в тази фантазна реалност, непредставимото започва да става единственият възможен отговор.

"It's rarely that hard sci-fi gets this much hype. Last I've seen is Ken Liu's (who is coincidentally translator for English edition and he did marvelous job) story collection Paper menagerie, which is not all sci-fi stories but it was appealing to roughly same crowd including those who decide who gets Hugo award.

Masterful combination intrigue, science, Chinese cultural revolution, different writing style and approach to story development than most western novels. I seen people have problem with slow pace but I enjoyed it and it I didn't find it dull a single moment.

Only major flaws are characters. They are all cold and calculated without much emotions and personality or warmth and I formed zero attachments to any of them.

"Tiene un nivel de complejidad científico-matemática alta, estoy seguro que más de alguno si lo lee, lo dejará de lado, pero si no se empeñan en descifrar la verborrea científica y se dejan llevar por las premisas, van a disfrutar mucho; no por el vértigo, que lo hay en cierta medida, sino por la originalidad con que nos presenta una nueva cara del universo. Me dejó con una sensación de credibilidad tan alta, que sí este libro se masificara en una transmisión de radio, como lo hizo la guerra de los mundos, todos creeríamos a pies juntos que lo que nos cuentan, está pasando de verdad, y que además, estamos perdidos. Es sensacional.

Una gran maravilla. Recomendable leer sin conocer de que va porque...¿es un thriller de conspiración? ¿Algún tipo de historia de la física? ¿Una historia de Hard SciFI con extraterrestres? ¿Algún tipo de historia mística bañada de astrofísica? En todo eso y más. Hay que ir al final del primer volumen para encontrar la respuesta....y entonces nos daremos cuenta de que estamos tan enganchados como para leer toda la trilogía.

"As someone who is only trying to get into sci-fi this year, I know my limitations well and I would never have picked up this critically acclaimed award winning book by my own volition. But one of my book clubs chose this as our May BOTM and I decided I should atleast give it a try. And after finishing it, I’m both blown away by it and also a bit sad, so let me try to articulate my thoughts.

It has not been easy to maintain focus for long periods of time on a book during this pandemic. Part of why I have been gravitating towards more short fiction these days, but when I committed to this book, I wanted to see it through. For someone who almost always finishes any sized book in just a few days, this one took me almost 20 days to read. While one part of the issue was the external circumstances, the other was the subject matter of the book itself. I found the idea of first contact with extra terrestrials very fascinating and there were some chapters which completely held my interest, but I couldn’t sustain that for the whole book.

The translation of this book is excellent and it never had that choppy feeling that can sometimes occur in translations. And however it might have been in the original, the book never felt difficult to read (which was how I thought it would be for me). Even the story being told in two timelines felt very easy to follow. I especially found the chapters during the Cultural revolution very fascinating, because I’m not much aware of Chinese history and it felt like a very honest look at the struggles and lives of the people of the time, on both sides of the civil war. The book is also extremely science heavy, and while I could understand what was going on in the context of the story, I could not tell you a single thing about the physics that was discussed. There were paragraphs and chapters devoted to physics discussions, most of them going over my head.

What really impressed me and what I feel is the soul of the book is the philosophical questions it asks. We have a group of humans who are fed up of humanity because we are destroying nature and environment without a care; we have another group which still cherishes humanity and wants to do anything to survive. And the author discusses both their POVs without clearly judging any of them, because they all have their valid points to make. And then there is the important question of what will happen if we do make contact with extra terrestrials - should we expect them to be a higher evolved intelligence than us and hope to learn from them?? Is it even possible to coexist with an advanced civilization? And why do we humans who can’t coexist with the people who live in other countries, who wage wars constantly and perpetuate mass killings of people, expect an outside civilization to be benevolent and grant us knowledge? These are some very interesting questions to ponder on and I know I’ll be thinking about them for a while.

I was initially intimidated when I saw the cast of characters at the beginning, but I quickly understood who were the main influencers in the story and was able to follow along. However, being used to first person POVs, this third person narrative felt very distant and I couldn’t connect to anyone. Even when I could objectively understand that something bad was gonna happen, I wasn’t emotionally attached to any of them to care enough. Also, except one main protagonist, there are hardly any female characters around which I thought was a real miss; and among the ones who were present, I felt that none of them were shown in any good light.

In the end, this is a book that definitely deserves all the prestige bestowed on it because of the concepts and philosophies it discusses, in a mostly accessible manner. It is more of an introspective book than an action packed alien invasion adventure novel, so you should keep that in mind before deciding to pick it up. If you are someone who is new to sci-fi like me, I would suggest reading more science fiction novels before venturing into this series. But if you are a science/physics nerd, then this would probably feel like home. I still haven’t decided if I want to continue with the series, but we shall see.

"I can definitely understand where the hype for The Three-Body Problem comes from. It's a well-developed novel with fascinating and complex scientific considerations as well with some fabulous philosophical considerations. It also involves one of my favourite themes in science-fiction: first contact with aliens.

The scientific ideas were explored and explained in a truly marvelous manner. The scientific groundwork was clearly well-researched and polished. It was a pleasure to read about this alternative reality in which technology to send messages far into the outer space was developed. My favourite parts, though, were the considerations of how a planet and its inhabitants could function in a system with three suns. I was therefore constantly looking forward to the chapters taking place in the game. It's also worth noting that even though I haven't had any contact with physics since high school, I was able to follow the thread of author's thoughts without becoming lost. He's really skilled with comprehensible explanations and drawing inventive analogies.

My personal bonus was the selection of a Polish scientist, Mikołaj Kopernik (known internationally also as Copernicus), as one of the avatars in the game.

Another aspect of the novel that I loved was the examination of some philosophical concepts and ambiguity of what is good or bad. Both on Earth and on Trisolaris there were a number of stands concerning what should be done with the contact with another planet. And even if they were drastically different, there were ultimately no good or bad sides, as all the groups had some relevant motivations. On Earth we have Adventists who support the alien invasion as they no longer have hope for humanity. They witness people destroying Earth, torturing animals, always finding excuses to wage war and spread hatred toward other people that they simply disagree with. All of this is valid, and I actually agree with them that both Earth and the majority of life forms would be better off without humans. On the other hand, we have a group that wants to find a way to defend themselves. Loyalty to one's own species and survival instinct are natural and hard to criticise. On Trilosaris these two stances are mirrored. Adventists find reflection in the groups of Trisolarans that find Earth and its life beautiful and don't want to destroy it, even if it dooms their own kind. The defensive terrestrial group finds reflection in the Trisolaran group that plans the invasion and destruction of humans, as they understand that co-existence would be impossible and ultimately this is the only way to survive. Every single one of these groups is justified in their actions, and therefore there is no good people and bad people in the novel. Selflessness means rejection of speciesism. Selfisheness, self-survival and embracing the speciesism means destruction of other life forms. These nuances were fantastically done.

The only weak part of the novel and the reason why I couldn't give it 5 stars were poorly developed characters. They were all bland, unlikeable and almost completely bereft of personality. Even worse were weak and few in between female characters. I'm not even sure if the book would pass a Bechdel test (and it's a really low bar). And the few female characters that were there were described in an awful way, with strong male gaze and focus on their appearance. And they were ALL both feminine (one side character was unfeminine and it was painted as something very bad) and slender (even when it was absurd like in the case of a female bodyguard with slender arms). I'm not sure if it's sexism or just creepy projection of author's fantasies, but it doesn't matter what one calls it. It doesn't change the fact that it was a detriment to the novel and it took me out of the story every single time.

Now I'm really curious where the next installments of the trilogy will take the story.

"""Pero con este nuevo equipamiento, las mismas partículas, los mismos niveles de energía y parámetros experimentales han dado resultados distintos, en función del acelerador y de cuándo se realizaba el experimento. El pánico ha cundido entre los físicos, que han repetido los experimentos bajo idénticas condiciones, obteniendo resultados distintos y sin patrón aparente.""

Este es uno de los enigmas que se plantean en , ¿qué pasaría en la sociedad humana si las leyes físicas, de repente y sin un aparente motivo lógico, dejasen de funcionar? ¿cómo reaccionaría la comunidad científica y el mundo en general?

Cixin Liu nos muestra este y otros interrogantes desde la perspectiva de la sociedad china comunista, primero nos da el contexto histórico introduciendo la Revolución que llevó al comunismo al poder y luego nos plantea problemas físicos desde esa realidad política. Alienígenas, sectas, suicidios en masa, videojuegos, todo forma parte de la misma trama que parte de la comprobación experimental de que la física ha dejado de ser coherente.

Puede resultar chocante lo de los videojuegos, pero es un recurso muy original que el autor sabe manejar muy bien para, a través de ellos (es uno en realidad), exponernos el problema de los tres cuerpos, que es uno de los temas principales de la trama y que los científicos, filósofos y demás mentes pensantes intentar resolver. Pues es muy necesario que sea resuelto para nuestra supervivencia.


Una trama compleja y muy bien elaborada, un elenco de personajes muy bien construidos y bastante heterogéneo, pues hay desde científicos a policías y militares, que en un principio parecen inconexos pero que a medida que avanza la novela vamos viendo el patrón y todo se va fundiendo y cobrando sentido.

En general la parte científica más técnica está muy bien explicada para los profanos en la materia, pero hubo algunos detalles que me costó asimilar y por eso le voy a restar una estrella, aunque el libro en sí es de diez.

"3/24/24 Edit: Doing a reread after watching the Netflix series.

3/29/2024: This was better the second time AFTER watching the Netflix series. On to The Dark Forest for the first time.

Original review from 2021:
I finished this book a few days ago and I’m still not sure how I felt about it. I have been debating on whether to read it or not for a couple of years and actually DNF’d the audiobook earlier this year. But then I read a review that made me decide to give it another try, but this time in print.

The Three-Body Problem won a Hugo award in 2015 so I figured there had to be something there. The story starts with China’s Cultural Revolution from the later 1960’s which I really knew nothing about, so from the beginning I was pulled in. From there the story jumped to a current timeline.

Much of the book consisted of math, physics, science, and game play, and honestly, I glazed through most of it. The characters never had me rooting for them. The game play built a different world from earth and humans, but it was very odd.

I must have had some interest in this book because I read it in 3 days. This was definitely hard sci-fi, which I typically love, but this book, not so much. But I didn’t hate it either. I just have no interest in continuing with the series.

This is currently being made into a movie or a series or something and I’m not quite sure how they’ll pull this off. It’s just a very odd story.

"I really enjoyed this one. First, the historical and present day setting were fascinating - whenever I read about the Cultural Revolution and its impact on the course of Chinese society I'm always astounded. Second, I found the slow reveal to be very effective. By the time we got to what I presume will be the subject of the rest of the trilogy (which I will remain vague about to avoid spoilers), I was already deeply hooked. I liked the characters, though they had a certain flatness that I've come to associate with Chinese novels over the years. The science was intriguing - the dimensional stuff towards the end was above my head but the rest was very comprehensible and clearly explained, especially the mathematical concept of the three body problem.
Finally, I very much appreciated the work of Ken Liu, who wrote in the postscript of his belief that ""The best translations into English do not, in fact, read as if they were originally written in English. The English words are arranged in such a way that the reader sees a glimpse of another culture’s patterns of thinking, hears an echo of another language’s rhythms and cadences, and feels a tremor of another people’s gestures and movements."" I think he nailed it.

Благодарение на Лиу Цъсин никога повече няма да подценя азиатски произведения в жанра научна фантастика.

“Трите тела” е точно това, което трябва да представлява истинската фантастика (поне в моите очи), а именно да ти отвее главата.
Оправдавайки всякакви очаквания, надхвърляйки всички граници и абсолютно заслужавайки си целият хайп около нея.

Главозамайващо представление, съдържащо в себе си екшън - трилър, мистерия, конспирации, морални дилеми, море от наука, на която няма да гледате вече по същия начин и доста прилично ниво на напрежение.

"In my opinion this book has an absolutely terrible narrative structure. I was disconnected from what was happening from the beginning to the end, and it was actually painful for me to finish. The skeletal narrative and empty character portrayals form a weak structure that shakily hold up some interesting ideas (thus 2 stars instead of 1), but I have to be honest those ideas don’t make the read worth it. I’m not interested in reading any other books in the series, and I’m a bit bewildered that this was rated so highly.

"Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem brings science fiction back to the era of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke—an era of wild and surreal concepts, loosely made to look plausible through their links to physics and mathematics. Set between China's Cultural Revolution and a version of its present, the novel leads readers on a disorientating path—with all the pace and excitement of a thriller—to dizzying revelations about the universe.

This book is the essence of what I admire in this genre. It is capable of shaking your imagination and keeping your head busy for weeks.,5,20,,,,,,
"In the midst of the Chinese cultural revolution, scientific progress is hampered by anti-occidental sentiment, If a scientist made any assertion that came close to contradicting a claim adopted by those in power, they would almost certainly be losing their life. In this turbulent sociopolitical environment, so many people have been subjected to unimaginable cruelties,

To say that this book was intellectually stimulating would be an understatement. This science fiction work is definitely the epitome of what this genre can be. The science here is front and center, and the author doesn't hesitate to plunge the reader in the details of it. Apart from the science itself, so many essential sociological and philosophical and environmental themes are explored in profound depth. Who is to say that aliens are so psychologically advanced that they outgrew the survivalist impulses of war and violence? Why do we assume that different species would act better than us just because they are more ""intelligent""?





One of my favourite aspects of this novel was the integration of a virtual reality system one of our main characters immerses himself in as a means of exploring the main ""mystery"" of the book, a sort of game revolving around figuring out a consistent pattern regarding the orbit of 3 suns around a planet, a seemingly chaotic orbit that makes it impossible for life to sustain itself long enough within the planet. If the pattern is cracked, inhabitants of the planet can find a way to effectively navigate this uncertain orbit and survive. The process of figuring out this mystery was very interesting to read about,

Since this is quite heavy on the hard science, with lengthy descriptions that go into great detail, it might not be the perfect read for readers who might find it to be tedious, but if you're a fan of science fiction, this is a must read that will surely be known as a Scifi classic sometime down the line.

The fact that I listened to the audiobook made the science much more digestible and enjoyable for me, and it was a great companion to my commutes! I'm very excited to be diving into the next book of this trilogy to see where the story goes, and I'm grateful that this work has been translated and was exposed to a global reading audience.

"A very enjoyable read overall, The Three-Body Problem has clear strengths and weaknesses.  On the plus side, Liu offers an intriguing story and scientific explanations so detailed that they should satisfy even the most demanding hard sci-fi fan.  As a Westerner, I also enjoyed some of the cultural differences revealed by a Chinese author.  WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!  For instance, I loved that the Trisolaran who warned Ye against responding was doing so not out of any altruistic or noble virtues, but to protect his job.

On the other hand, I did not find the author's insights into people to be particularly realistic or even credible.  Most notably, I simply could not believe that so many individuals would actively work for the destruction of all mankind--including their own descendants.  This already incomprehensible notion was made even more ridiculous by the fact that the human collaborators knew that Trisolaran culture could be as warlike and dictatorial as the worst cultures in Terran history.

"“Is it possible that the relationship between humanity and evil is similar to the relationship between the ocean and an iceberg floating on its surface? Both the ocean and the iceberg are made of the same material. That the iceberg seems separate is only because it is in a different form. In reality, it is but a part of the vast ocean …”

These are young Ye Wenije’s musings after she has run the gamut of human cruelty in the so-called Cultural Revolution, first having witnessed her father, a professor of physics, being beaten to death by 14-year old Red Guards and later facing betrayal and torture herself. Her disappointment with humankind leads her to the following sinister conclusion:



Years go by but Wenije never revises her crushing verdict on humanity, and so when she has the opportunity to contact a race of extraterrestrials, she uses it, knowing too well that the consequences for humanity will be disastrous as soon as the aliens have arrived, which will happen in about 400 years.

Like many other genres, science fiction has a limited set of motifs and ideas and one of its hallmarks is doubtless the author’s ability to use these motifs – here the expected arrival of the alien Trisolarans – in order to encourage his readers to think about social and philosophical issues. How would humanity react when contact with extraterrestrials is established, is one of the questions addressed by Liu, and the answer he gives is anything but uplifting. Another question is why most people think that a race which has been able to solve the technological problems keeping us from travelling in space would automatically be more developed with regard to ethics. This assumption can be put into question by looking at Terran history, which is full of examples of how technologically superior civilizations used their power to subject, enslave, exploit or even annihilate populations that lack these technological advances. Why should this principle of selfishness not apply to extraterrestrials coming to “visit” us?

is excellent science fiction, well-founded on the author’s scientific knowledge, which he has a tendency to unfold at length, and although the book comes in the guise of a detective story – a nano-scientist named Wang Miao starts investigating the deaths of a number of scientists and is aided by a rather ruthless cop named Shi Qiang –, it also manages to build up a very believable scenario of first-contact between two planets, not even forgetting that within each of the two cultures there might be diverging interests and beliefs. The utter hatred against humanity that is shown by Wenije and some of her fellow-combatants seems to mirror the mindset of at least some of today’s radical environmentalists, which makes the book even more thought-provoking. If you are mainly interested in space opera science fiction or if you need characters to identify with, then you are well-advised to give a wide berth, because the author concentrates on science a lot and the characters come over as comparatively wooden – Wang, for instance, is a family father, but we hardly see any interaction with his wife and son, and Wenije is as ruthless as her enemies – and will fail to capture your desire to empathize. Nevertheless, I felt completely intrigued by the narrative structure, the author’s imagination and his ideas: For instance, is it not highly ironic that the factional strife inside Wenije’s sect-like organization is redolent of the deadly intrigues that were spun in the Cultural Revolution, which alienated Wenije from mankind in the first place?

is not an easy read, but for me it was well worth the effort in many ways.

"Oh. Wow.

This is a book that I've been intending to read for a while... right after I knock off the other 120 unread books. But apparently our meeting was fated. My mother accidentally checked it out from the library, the day before I was to leave for home. My mother despises SF, so I had to read it, and I had 24 hours to do it.

This is one of the few books I've ever read that I wanted to restart as soon as I finished (though, part of that is because I had to read it too fast in the first place). Unfortunately, that's going to have to wait, now, as the book and I are about to part ways!

I felt it started a little woodenly, but wasn't sure whether that was an artifact of the translation or intentional on the part of the author—since I've never read a original that I didn't love, I was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt as a translator. Pretty soon, I was immersed and it stopped mattering.

It's a far-from-classic alien invasion story—after all, the aliens in question won't be here for 450 years—with a lot of hard mathematics & physics thrown in (the math is all virtual: be not afraid!). He almost lost me at unfolding protons into two dimensions—I mean, why? We don't work in two-D, we work in three, so it makes far more sense to unfold an 11-dimensional proton into three-D. In any case, it should be possible; practically, maybe not so much.

Early in the book, a physicist commits suicide because she's discovered that the immutable Laws of physics are not-so-immutable. did this in —somewhat more believably. In Chiang's case, a mathematician couldn't cope with finding a proof that 1=2. That really would undermine everything we think we know. In Liu's case, particle physicists are finding that their experiments are not reproducible. OK, I'm no graduate physicist, let alone one of the top minds on the planet, but that just says to me that at a quantum level, there's chaos: which we already knew. otoh, maybe my reaction is like that of the husband of the mathematician in Chiang's story, who essentially says ""So what? Mathematics still works, right?""

Later on, we meet Mike Evans, a disciple of (). Mike's supposed to be a bad guy (such as there are, in this story: Liu really doesn't judge anybody), but I'm predisposed to judge him as worse than he probably is because of the Singer connection. It's not that I really disagree with everything Singer says, but I had to take a Scientific Ethics course in university where I failed to realize until it was too late that I wasn't supposed to Singer, but was required to swallow his propaganda whole. I'm a little biased...

Liu manages to discuss politics, man’s inhumanity to man (and other creatures), the advance of science, and just about anything else under the sun (or suns), all in the context of the three-body problem (a real “holy grail” of physics), and all, apparently, without upsetting the censors of what is still a totalitarian state. A tour-de-force, and well worth all the attention it has been getting around the world.

"Hm, jako intrigantno djelo.

Vabe nas riječima ""opsega Dine i akcije Dana Nezavisnosti"" što sigurno znate kako ne može biti istina, možda bih po tom pitanju bio precizniji, no pročitavši samo prvu knjigu trilogije ne mogu.

Osnovni zaplet je fascinantan, cca 4.5 svj. godina od nas postoji svijet sa tri sunca - tri sunca međusobno vezana orbitama i gravitacijom.
A problem ""tri tijela"" je potpuno matematički nerješiv - nije moguće predvidjeti položaje i međudjelovanje tako da se okolnim planetima (kojih bijaše 28) pruža prilika biti izloženima mnogobrojnim razdobljima kaosa (tu spada sve između požara i ledenih doba do potpunog raspada planeta), te malom broju stabilnih kada se stvaraju i razvijaju civilizacije na jednom od planeta. (ostali su jedan po jedan uništeni)
Detaljnije o tome nas Cixin upoznaje putem računalne igre/simulacije u koju uranjaju neki likovi i to može biti naporniji dio knjige no nužan je da upoznate svijet

Stotine ih je dostiglo neki od nivoa razvoja, svi su propali i krenuli iznova no ozbiljne stvati počinju kada jedno razdoblje potraje malo duže i dostigne let u svemir.
Vjerojatno bi ih mogla zainteresirati Zemlja koja je za njih raj, vječno stabilno doba.

U Kini (tamo se odvija sva radnja) malo izvode ""Kulturnu revoluciju"" malo čiste njene posljedice (radnja s preklapa u sva perioda).

I netko odjednom primijeti kako je zaustavljen razvoj svih osnovnih, teorijskih znanosti na Zemlji - ups! Tehnika nastavlja dalje no teorija je blokirana - nema napretka i civilizacija će propasti.

Cixin glavnu radnju razvija sporo, vjerojatno je od početka planirao 3 knjižurine pa nikuda ne žuri, stoga lako možete upasti u dosadu.
Moja glavni problem je bio što sam se često gubio u imenima likova i lokacija tako da čitanju treba pristupiti s malo jačom koncentracijom.

Likovi su užasno hladni, pokreću ih analitički umovi, emocije nula. Ima nešto bijesa no i to je led ledeni.
Otprilike ovako: kinezi devastiraju veliko šumsko područje, mjesto za gniježđenje ptičje vrste blizu izumiranja - amera to pogodi pa 30 godina sam pošumljava.
Onda kinezi opet sve posijeku pa amer odmah zaključi kako čovječanstvo treba istrijebiti - kompletno!
U par stranica od eko-aktivista do terminatora homo sapiensa.
(Postoji samo jedan lik nalik na zapadno ljudsko biće. (ima i zapadnjaka no za sada su svi prateće, dvodimenzionalne, uloge))

Ima ih s takvim idejama još pa nas malkice prodaju vanzemaljcima (""halo! dođite i pokorite nas""), a tuđinci potekoše u brodove i evo ih već za 450 godina da nas pokore, istrijebe i slično.
Kako se mi ne bi baš dobro pripremili, alieni nam zeznu teorijsku znanost i ostave prisluškivače svega (na ingeniozan način, no nisam previše ulazio u problem komprimiranja 11 dimenzija u samo tri jednog protona)

Znanstvenog dijela ima puno i jako je dobar s hrpicom strašno zanimljivih ideja i rješenja (pročitajte kako napraviti računalo od 30 milijuna kineskih vojnika :) )

Znači: vrlo uvjerljivi jaki hard SF s dosta znanosti, azijska kultura i filozofija života, sporo razvijanje radnje, romantika ispod nule pa razmislite privlači li vas.
Ja ću, vjerujem, pročitati i drugi dio - eng. prijevod izlazi za par mjeseci.


edit: ovo djelo je dobitnik Huga 2015. za najbolji roman što prilično govori

I like the book's grounding in real science. And I like that it feels specifically Chinese; the Cultural Revolution hangs over the whole book, and the characters' reactions to events like the dismantling of science and the possibility of alien contact come directly out of those events. (There is also an American who gets to the same place for different reasons.)

But it does seems like Cixin is so excited about science that he forgets about plot sometimes. There are long passages describing some theory or other instead of happening, which isn't as dire as it sounds but it's still not always gripping. And I think it's likely that there are lots of scifi authors dealing with the dramatic possibilities of dimensions five through eleven, and this just seems cool to me because I don't read a lot of scifi.

And I wish I'd paid more attention and realized that this is the first book of a trilogy. It definitely feels like it; the plot is not at all over when the book is, and I don't really feel like reading the rest of it.

I'd say this is worthy if you dig scifi anyway, maybe not crucial if you don't.

"This is the book you may have heard just got onto the Hugo ballot, following the sturm und drang and reshuffling of this year's Hugo drama. I think it's a worthy entry on the ballot; while it may not be the best SF novel I've read this year, it's certainly got everything a Hugo-winner should have: an epic scope, an intriguing set-up, and a lot of speculative science.

is a Chinese SF novel, of which there are not many translated into English. The translation was exceptionally smooth, so that I rarely felt like the prose was either stilted by its non-English origins or lacking something in translation.

The basic plot is nothing new to the genre: humans make contact with an alien civilization, and find out the aliens aren't friendly. What makes it different is that the humans who make contact are not the usual Americans or Europeans. Instead, it is Chinese scientists at a military radio observatory whose secret SETI project discovers the ""Trisolaran"" civilization. Of course it's not just the Chinese who have discovered the aliens, but all the action in this book takes place in China, and involves mostly Chinese characters. A first contact story told in a Chinese context, beginning during Mao's Cultural Revolution and ending (on a cliffhanger, since this is the first book in a trilogy) in modern-day China is certainly different for most Western readers, and should be pleasing to those who complain about Earth vs aliens stories always being the United States vs. aliens.

The aliens actually don't appear until the end of the book, and then only in a chapter describing their preparations on their own homeworld. Instead, most of this book focuses on the uncovering of a conspiracy on Earth, hosted in the virtual reality of an online game called ""Three Body,"" which is actually a recruiting tool for human factions who are preparing to welcome our alien overlords. How these factions came to exist, how everyone found out about the alien invasion fleet en route, and why the founders of the conspiracy chose to side with the aliens, becomes a long saga with some social and political commentary inserted like a knife into an outwardly straightforward SF conspiracy thriller.

A good read, with lots of theoretical physics for the SF purists, genuinely alien aliens, and no shortage of action, though most of this comes in the final act, and it looks like the real action will have to wait until the next book. I'm definitely looking forward to the continuation.

"YES! Yes, YES, YES!!!! This book is AMAZING. So much gushing to do, but let's begin here:

I hated The Martian, and I formed an impression then that perhaps I just didn't like ""hard sci-fi"", as that supposed novel was described. But turns out, it's not hard sci-fi that I detest, it's people conveying the purpose of science as the struggle to engineer clever solutions.

Compared to the brittleness of the theoretically deprived , is , grounded firmly not only in the newest physics (from quantum to strings to particle theory), but in the philosophical foundations underlying the science (how is science like faith? how do ethics enter the world of scientific research, and where do these fields intersect? how is theory supported by experimentation? and on and on! If you've got a question about physics or the social, cultural, religious, political intersections of science and society, Cixin's got you covered). Some of his imagery is a bit... preposterous (i.e. a proton unfolded in two dimensions enveloping a planet), but technically not incorrect (it could be unfolded, theoretically, true, but I doubt we'd see it even if it were technologically possible).

There's a lot more to love: Cixin presents significant amounts of historical detail into the Cultural Revolution, the pace of his story is impeccable, his characters are all too recognizably human (even as we may grow to detest them or to abhor their choices), and to top it all off, the novel's structure lends it a quite trippy vibe (there's people in a video game that isn't quite what it seems, there's world-wide conspiracies, secret messages being sent between worlds, chaotic-theory manifesting in strange ways, etc).

I wouldn't say is perfect - the translation was quite choppy (I would imagine Chinese is extremely challenging to translate to English - and I'm not sure we'd be better off with a translation that's more eloquent in English but that corresponds less with the Chinese). Some questions are not considered at all (for example, if we found ET lifeforms, the chances that they'd be like us would be incredibly small). The characters are not terribly developed.

But, whatever, you can't do everything, and for the amount of thinking inspires, and for the scientific, cultural, historical detail it provides: A++++!

"The Three-Body Problem----was a problem.

Book Information

The Three-Body Problem was written by Liu Cixin. The book was published on October 14th 2014 and is 400 pages. The book has been widely recognized: Hugo Award for Best Novel (2015), Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (2014), Locus Award Nominee for Best Science Fiction Novel (2015), John W. Campbell Memorial Award Nominee for Best Science Fiction Novel (2015), Prometheus Award Nominee for Best Novel (2015), Premio Ignotus for Mejor Novela Extranjera (2017), Tähtivaeltaja Award Nominee (2019), and 本屋大賞 Nominee for Translated Fiction (2020).



Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt or to fight against the invasion.



I should like this book. I really wanted to like this book. But I just didn’t.

I tried but I couldn’t get into it. I found it confusing. Things happen which seem to make no sense (at least to me) but then are kinda explained later but not enough to assuage the frustration I felt as I was trying to understand what was going on.

There are a lot of characters that are difficult to keep straight. I fully realize this is partly cultural in nature (many Chinese names that westerners may not be accustomed to) but it played into my confusion as I read.

There are some very cool science fiction concepts but those were small bright spots in an otherwise long book that I forced myself to finish. In the end, I didn’t feel like the 400 pages added a tremendous amount beyond the 67-word summary above (which is directly from the description on Goodreads).



I don’t recommend it. It’s one of the very few books I have ever said that about. Having said that—most of the world disagrees with me, so to be fair, your mileage may vary.

"Despite some heavy doses of physics, and some loss from Chinese to English translation, Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem is stunning achievement in the sci-fi genre.


I love sci-fi genre a whole lot, maybe not as much as fantasy or perhaps thriller, but it’s a close 3rd. After reading so many reviews about ‘The Three-Body’ series, I thought it was worth a try. The ongoing accolades to Mr Liu’s body of work also made my decision an easy one. The stats show that each entry in the series has sold about 500,000 copies in the original Chinese, making Mr. Liu the best-selling Chinese science-fiction author in decades.




The ‘Three-Body problem’ is in fact a complex amalgamation of physics, quantum mechanics in predicting the initial positions and velocities of three point masses as described by Newton’s laws. Historically, the first specific three-body problem to receive extended study was the one involving the Moon, the Earth, and the Sun.




On a good day, after acing AP physics, I might have understood a ‘fraction’ of the hardcore science involved in this story. That being told, the ‘over the edge’ scientific involvement of the story, does little to detract from the overall accomplishment of this brilliant book!


I wholeheartedly agree with my friend TS’s in her review, that the less the reader knows about the book, the more enjoyment and surprise you’ll get out of it! The science is edgy, and at times obfuscates the obvious excellent narrative, but I promise if you stick with the book beyond the 30% mark,

"In 1967 Ye Wenjie witnesses the death of her father, and is sent to the countryside to cut trees, through which she eventually gets the chance to work on the Red Coast defence project, that is actually a cover for something else… and gets a chance to do something that changes the fate of humanity. Four decades later nanotech engineer Wang Miao is given the the task to infiltrate a secretive scientist group, leading him into the world of an online game that is more than that, revealing an extinction threat to humanity…

It’s quite interesting to read a scifi novel that is from a non-Western view. The language and how the story progresses is one sign, and another how Western characters here are somewhat less in the picture, just like in Western ones the non-Western ones are briefer. The list of characters at the beginning of the book is useful, if one needs to get started in who’s who.

Ye Wenjie’s reasons for her deed are clear enough to me, and I think she realises her choice is not 100 % right in the end, though I think there’s some optimism left in her cold soul. Wang Miao was important for the plot – and it was interesting to see his journey in the Three-Body Problem game – but he feels less personal to me than Da Shi the rude but smart police detective, who we will see in the next book also. The part of the story about Wang’s photography was nicely creepy and gave me goosebumps. I do wish some other character’s, like Ye’s daughter and some of the members of the scietist group would’ve gotten more depth, but perhaps some will get it in the other books (I don’t mind if they won’t though).

Didn’t mind that I couldn’t understand all of the physics in the book, my reading went fine without that. The Trisolaris world, and the things they
was quite interesting, and what happened to Evans’ ship was quite awesome in its horror.
The book left me eager to proceed to the next book (and I have done so), and had many moments and scenes that were something I will think about even after finishing the book. The characters were not too flat even when just lesser characters and it’s good to read some non-Western scifi :) Looking forward to what’s next.

"“To effectively contain a civilization’s development and disarm it across such a long span of time, there is only one way: kill its science.”

Oh boy, this was disappointing.
I had high hopes for this: sciency science fiction with aliens and from a different culture? Heck yes, I was hooked. The author actually has tons of knowledge when it comes to physics and engineering and I appreciated that. I love my science fiction heavy on the science part and this book was that.
Why was I so disappointed then? I have never struggled so much to finish a book. This book literally felt like torture and I wouldn’t have finished it, hadn’t I read this for a challenge.
The author is just a really horrible writer in my opinion. This story had an interesting premise, but he managed to take all of the fun and the thrill out of it. I felt so detached from everything in the book. The characters were exchangeable and had no personality and I will probably not remember any of them a month from now.
The story just felt like an outline that was filled with a lot of description of the setting and science bits. The dialogues were just there to transfer information from one random character to another random character.
I’m not going to continue the series and I highly doubt I will pick up a book by this author again.

"The Three-Body Problem, already a huge hit in China, is now the very first Chinese science fiction novel available for English-language readers. Here, Liu asks us to imagine what life was like during China’s Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and then apply that knowledge of intellectual harassment and violent suppression to the present-day, and to an opportunity to make first contact with an alien race. Should the human race resist such a meeting, or welcome the aliens with open arms, in the hope that otherworldly brains can save humanity from its self-destructive tendencies? And there’s so much more: physics, math, astrophysics, a virtual-reality “game” in which people try to solve the “three-body problem,” and all written so that a non-science person like me can understand it. Add to that Ken Liu’s beautiful, elegant translation. The Dark Forest, the next novel in the trilogy, is out in English next year. -Rachel Cordasco

"REVIEW RELECTURA AUDIOLIBRO 2024:

Me ha gustado muchísimo más de lo que recordaba, le subo la nota al 5 y lo agrego a mi self de top. Prácticamente me he pasado los últimos 5 días con el audiolibro puesto a todas horas mientras estaba ocupado en otros menesteres.




Había oído que en el final había un cliffhanger.... y calificarlo así es quedarse corto.

Imaginad la cara de tonto que se me ha quedado cuando creía que estaba en el cenit del libro y al pasar de página en el Kindle aparece “El bosque oscuro” (estoy leyendo la versión Kindle con los tres libros en uno)

Salvo por esa puñalada trapera del autor, la verdad es que muy bien. Un poco pesado en algunos momentos puntuales: la clase magistral de Sistemas Digitales de Ingeniería Informática (las puertas lógicas) y los sofones.

La narrativa me ha recordado mucho a Guerra Mundial Z, donde se desgranaba la historia en pequeñas historias. No es que sea asi del todo en este caso pero se le da un aire

"It’s bad.
I suppose I am also to blame. I expected a modern hard-scifi, but got old-school hard-scifi with aliens that are simply humans who look different, and scientific realism that exists only on occasion.
The only redeeming quality is an accidental one – the history and culture that the people in this book share, which can be interesting and unfamiliar at times. But this is not enough to offset the negative.
Also, I listened to this as an audiobook, and during the second half of the story I also had high fever. I think the fever helped dumb me down, because I liked the second half more than the first, but it also means I might have hallucinated parts that didn’t happen. Feel free to correct me if I did.

PART ONE: the writing

The writing is terrible. Not just kind of bad – truly terrible. Some of it might be due to the translation, but most are things that were clearly part of the original.

Some of the metaphors are strange, for example: “Coldness now pressed toward the earth like a giant hand”.

Many of the more objective descriptions are also strange, for example: “Cold enough to turn stone into dust”. Are we supposed to take it at face value or as hyperbole? Because it makes little sense.
The character writing and dialogue is some of the worst I have ever seen. Not a single character feels even half-human. They say what the plot needs them to say and react to what the plot needs them to react.

For example, several characters introduce themselves in a way reminiscent of 90’s anime characters (not a quote, but I swear this is what it sounds like):
Imagine you are entering a secret meeting filled with important individuals, then a man stands up and introduces himself like this: “My name is John Smith, I am a general in the US army. As a child my father had been my main source of inspiration, but at the age of nine I discovered a terrible truth – he has been cheating on my mother for three years at that point! My mother confronted him, and he left our family forever. Soon after, my mother died of heartbreak, and I was left to fent for myself on the streets. Two years later, an army soldier decided to adopt me, and he was the reason I decided to join the military myself.” The man then sits down, and we never hear from him again.
I wrote better dialog when I was fifteen. This isn’t a boast – the bar is just that low.

Another example (again, not a quote) of a common way of speaking in this book:
Imagine a good friend calls you and tells you they have something important to tell you, something that could save all of humanity, and the conversation goes like this:
“What did you wish to tell me?”
“There are so many things I wish to tell you”.
“Then please do, the fate of the world depends on it”
“What I wish to tell you relates to our greatest fear”
“Is it war? Natural disaster?”
“I suppose that it’s both, in a way”.
“Is it about project (whatever)?”
“Maybe. That is not for me to decide. What I have to tell you is far more mysterious”
“What is it, then?”
“Are you sure you are ready to hear it?”
“Yes”
”Even though it might change you forever?”
“Yes”
“Very well. It is the answer to the question you asked me yesterday”
“About the result of the experiment?”
“No”
“About the government’s decision?”
“No”
Just say it already!!! No one talks like that, except kids who are trying to annoy someone on purpose. And this repeats SO MANY TIMES. I can’t help but feel that this is either the author’s misguided attempt at mystery or it was added as filler to make the book slog for a while longer. Speaking of which, this book could and should have been 30% shorter.
Another example: one person tells another about something that happened to him, and at some point, he says: “She pointed something at me – a gun”. This would work when describing events directly, as it takes him a moment to realize what is pointed at him, but no one would tell this to someone else in this manner, after the events were long over. They’ll say: “She pointed a gun at me”.

Some of the plot points are so strange, yet no one comments or asks about them:



Another:


Another: in the game, the protagonist meets several historical figures. Why...? All they do is give exposition, contribute terrible dialogue, and often act in ways the original wouldn’t have. So why? They even have newton invent binary calculations, logic gates, and computers.
More on the game: why does the protagonist do (almost) nothing? He has the entire knowledge of humanity available, yet he never uses it. He either observes, asks stupid questions, or tries to give a handful of bad suggestions.

Lastly, the writing has no depth whatsoever. Not just in characters and dialogue, but also in ideas: the book introduces several philosophical ideas but does not explore them in any meaningful way. A main character wishes for humanity to end, but there is no exploration of this question about the meaning of life. A few people spout some exposition about it, then don’t talk about it again. In this book, it is somehow normal for a person to say (not a quote): “Nice to meet you, I am (). Through my suffering I understood that humanity must die, and have spent my life and fortune for that goal. And you are?”

PART TWO: the science

In old-school SF fashion, the science is accurate until suddenly it isn’t. Why put so much scientific details if you are just going to ignore it at critical moments?

The aliens have exactly the same mental workings of human beings. Not only that, but the author attempted to create giant in-your-face parallels, to tell the readers again and again that these aliens are just like us. I understand that this is a popular way to portray aliens in SF, with the expressed intention of making this parallel. But what is explored here exactly? The aliens aren’t an interesting mirror of some dark side of humanity – they are exactly the same as our protagonists. And it gets worse: the aliens can immediately translate the first message received from earth, and make full sense of what’s written in it.

Aside from that, there are some basic mistakes in the science. For example:


Another: “As the bodies drifted, their blood boiled in the vacuum. Their inner organs were vomited out, until they turned into strange blobs [...]”. Not how this works.

Another: using entangled pairs of particles for instantaneous communication. This goes against our current understanding of physics – It should not be possible. If you wish to create a world where such a thing is in fact possible, then invent some explanation. But I get a strong feeling that the author actually thinks this is possible, while not addressing the issues with it; for example, faster-than-light communication can be used to send messages to the past. If the aliens have this communication, why not use it for time travel? At least give the readers a reason for why they won’t or can’t do it.

Another: the aliens say that if they turn a proton into a black hole (in space) it will start taking in mass and destroy their planet. In reality, a black hole with the mass of a proton will evaporate into Hawking radiation almost instantaneously.

Conclusion:
Sometimes I dislike a book because it simply isn’t for me. This time, however, the book is actually terrible.

"The longest polemic against the intentional fallacy in world history commences in this volume.

We see it in the prologue, ostensibly a nuanced critique of the Cultural Revolution that nevertheless highlights that the authorship of the universe is open to doubt: When a scientist is interrogated by zealous ideologues with “Time began with a singularity? So what was there before the singularity?” and answers “Nothing,” the judgment that issues forth is that “The theory leaves open a place to be filled by God.” (18). The reply: “If by ‘God’ you mean some kind of super-consciousness outside the universe, I don’t know if it exists or not. Science has given no evidence either way.” (19).

Just as it is impossible to infer the existence of a creator deity and therefore the creative intention thereof from the mere existence of a purportedly created universe, so too it is impossible to infer the existence of an author and the intention thereof from the mere existence of a purportedly authored text.

The complication in the author-text relation here concerns the text as an exercise of representative capacity. We see this in how both Earthling and Trisolaran respond to their respective first contact with another stellar civilization. The separate representatives have identical thoughts prior to first contact:
The earth had sent the general broadcast, a message of friendship (349), and the earthling monitored for a response; the response came back from the Trisolaran monitor—a warning not to answer lest his civilization discover the location of hers and invade it (272-73). Realizing that “the fate of the entire human race” was in her hands, the Earthling monitor answered by inviting conquest “Our civilization is no longer capable of solving its own problems” (276)—an ostensibly humanitarian motive—but actually “on that morning of the transmission, she had gotten revenge against the entire human race” (299).

Similarly, the Trisolaran monitor knew that “the fate of Trisolaran civilization” was in his hands (352), he sent his warning not to answer—a seeming altruistic act of sparing the Earth from “the bombardment of an enormous interstellar fleet” (350), but actually premised on his looming obsolescence—post-contact “Trisolaris would surely reduce the number of listening posts” (id.), making his skills being too specialized to be transferable and thus resulting in his being “forcibly dehydrated and burnt” (id.).

Neither side says what it means, even though both actually believed identical things looking at the same text—until new signifiers entered: a greeting, then a warning. The first responses made in representative capacity were congenial, but were ultra vires to the extent that each representative substituted its own judgment for the judgment of the civilization they each respectively represent. This is one key to the problem of the intentional fallacy. As Derrick Bell notes in one of his articles in the anthology, the problem of representative capacity and scope of representation are common problems for attorneys working issues about which they feel passionately, such as civil rights, but where their idealist goals may conflict with the pragmatic remedies that their clients desire—such as how attorneys fought for school desegregation when some clients actually wanted the remedies available under the segregation regime in the United States—separate but equal, wherein segregation was maintained, assuming egalitarianism in the separate budgets. It is unethical for the attorneys to substitute their political goals, however laudable and correct, for the clients’ equally laudable and correct pragmatic preference that their kids receive school funding immediately.

This problem accrues for authors, who also act in representative capacity and who also risk substituting their ideological preferences for those whom they represent; they have the added difficulty beyond attorneys insofar as writers are not normally retained to represent someone specifically; a writer’s representation of another is almost always ultra vires, unless it is a ghost written biography or other paid propaganda. When the representative suffers from the defect of representative capacity confusion, it is impossible to decide between interpretations: is the representation restating the view of the author or character, of representer or representation? In law, we normally impute the representative’s words to the represented person; literary representation is more subtle—but yet literary malpractice causes passionate responses precisely because ultra vires representations can have abiding effects on the represented. It does not help that literary representation is afflicted by a terminal undecidability on this question, the default condition of all reading. We should of course revel in it, rather unlike the aliens in this novel, who somewhat generically prefer to extinguish the source of ambiguity. It wouldn't be a geocentric aliens tale without some degree of sacrificing subtlety for monologic conventionalism, however.

"It’s always been a frightening premise within science fiction: What if our first contact with an alien intelligence was initiated not by a rational, empathetic human but by an ideologue? This is the terrifying premise behind Chinese science fiction author Cixin Liu’s novel “The Three-Body Problem”, translated into English by Ken Liu.

The novel begins amidst the turmoil of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, starting in 1966, in which Communist leader Mao Zedong, in an attempt to reassert control over a government that he felt was veering too far from true communist ideals, encouraged the youth to rise up. What resulted was a tragic era of violent anti-intellectual insurrection. Over a million Chinese citizens were killed at the hands of other Chinese citizens, and millions more were imprisoned for ridiculous charges. The aftermath of the Cultural Revolution is still felt today.

Unbeknownst to the world, the Chinese government was working on a top-secret scientific project. Called Project Red Coast, the idea was to create a satellite dish that could transmit and receive broadcasts in a much wider bandwidth. The search for extraterrestrial life was an international obsession in the ‘60s and ‘70s, so it’s perfectly conceivable that communist China may have attempted something similar, although as far as I know, Project Red Coast is completely fictional.

Ye Wenjie, a young astrophysicist student, was one of the workers on the project. After many months and years of not receiving any alien broadcast, the program was slated to be cancelled. One night, cleaning up in the lab, Ye Wenjie hears something coming over the speaker. It is a message, of extraterrestrial origin. A simple message: “Do not answer!” So, of course, she answers…

To tell more would be spoilers, and this is one of those novels that unfolds slowly and beautifully, like a gorgeous flower. One that happens to be quite poisonous…

Several things that might be helpful knowing prior to reading:

1) There is a lot of history of China from the mid- to late-20th century that is referenced, and not all of it is explained. Liu, a Chinese citizen, grew up with this history. He learned about it in school. It is the history of his culture and people, but it may not be yours. I’m simply saying: do a little pre-reading before diving into this, especially about the Cultural Revolution of 1966. Besides being fascinating, it will also be helpful in, at the very least, understanding the context of the story.

2) There is a hella ton of math and science in this book. If you’re like me—-someone who loves science but occasionally has trouble understanding some of the concepts—-it may help to have Google on stand-by. I had to look up a lot of stuff. Not ashamed of that, just being honest…

3) Despite this story being grounded in some really hard science, this novel is less science fiction than it is horror. By that, I mean “cosmic horror”. And please don’t read into that the inevitable Lovecraftian connection. Forgot Lovecraft. I am talking about the cosmic horror that we all experience early in life when we first look up at a night sky and realize just how vast it is. Beautiful, yes, but also indifferent to our meaningless little lives and extremely horrifying in all the infinite unknowns it holds…

Yeryüzünde türlerin hızla ortadan kalkışını ve çevresel çöküşün boyutlarını hatırlayacak, bu konuda daha fazla duyarlılık geliştireceksiniz.

Ve sanırım siz de benim gibi, bu kitabı okuyup bitirdikten sonra sabırsızlıkla Liu Cixin'in diğer kitaplarının da İngilizce'ye (ya da Türkçe'ye) çevrilmesini bekleyeceksiniz.

The Three-Body Problem bir üçlemenin ilk kitabı. İkinci ve üçüncü kitaplar 2015 yılının ortalarında İngilizce'ye çevrilecekmiş. Umarım en kısa zamanda Türkçe'ye de çevrilir.

Liu Cixin 1963 doğumlu, Çin'de çok sevilen bir BK yazarı. Çin'in Hugo ödülü kabul edilen Galaxy Award'ı tam sekiz kez kazanmış.

Ben uzun zamandır okuduğum BK romanlarında Asimov, Clarke, Herbert gibi yazarların o ""eski"" ve tadına doyulmaz BK zevkini almıyordum. Liu Cixin bana unutulmaya yüz tutmuş o ""eski"" BK zevkini fazlasıyla verdi.

So thought provoking! Didn't feel any emotional pull though, which I do kind of wish I felt, especially since I think Ye Wenjie could've been an emotional center. But maybe I'll have a bigger emotional pull in the next books? Anyways enjoyed it nonetheless though I'm definitely not smart enough for some of the concepts!

Si no le doy más puntuación es porque si bien el libro es muy explicativo a la hora de hablar de teorías o conceptos muy específicos, es porque soy consciente de que las ciencias no son mi fuerte por lo tanto hay cosas que me debo haber perdido, así que #myfault

Sinceramente el libro me tenía aterrada, hay algo tan solido en la trama, en la forma en la que todo se va desenvolviendo que me costaba separar la realidad de la ficción. Se siente tan inmenso el mundo de Problema, que es imposible no sentirse como los personajes, una mota insignificante en el universo, y es bueno recordarlo de vez en cuanto.

La historia me pareció muy fluida, a pesar de toda la ciencia involucrada en el libro, mis partes favoritas eran las narradas por Ye Wenjie porque se sabe que es ahí donde están escondidas las partes relevantes.

A pesar de la fluidez hay un caos notable en la dirección de la historia, a pesar de saber el tema principal de los libros no entendía como del inicio íbamos a llegar al 'punto', y lo cierto es que el viaje fue enrevesado con elementos que se sentían un tanto dispersos pero que en realidad eran parte relevante de la trama.

Y en general los personajes se ven eclipsados por la trama, no hay mucho desarrollo de las personalidades de estos (excepto en Ye Wenjie, que me me encanta #sorrynotsorry), así que en la mayoría de los casos no empaticé con ninguno, pero no siempre es necesario hacerlo para apreciar una buena historia.

De momento aún estoy con el hype por las nubes así que dejaré la reseña completa para el blog, pero el libro me encantó.

"Last read of the year, and what a book it was.

This is a fascinating, sprawling work of science fiction. It spans multiple generations--the timeline switches between the Cultural Revolution and present-day China--and I was completely hooked.

At times I found the writing to feel a bit formal, but I got used to the style fairly quickly. Ken Liu's translation is especially great because of the footnotes he provides when there are cultural and historical contexts that wouldn't be immediately apparent to non-Chinese readers. Those footnotes enriched my reading experience quite a bit. I found the shifts in perspective/time a bit jarring, but ultimately loved SO MUCH of this book that I overlooked that.

This is very much hard sci-fi, and I think having a verrrrrry basic understanding of physics really helps when reading this book. Liu (author, not translator), does a great job of succinctly explaining very complex theories, laws, and scientific processes. However, if you don't have some basic knowledge in place I can see how it would be easy to feel a little lost in all of the jargon.

From a literary perspective, Liu does an incredible job of examining expansive and impactful themes. He plays around with contrast quite a bit, and his writing really soars when he focuses on the dichotomy of our significance/insignificance in the universe.

I can't wait to continue this series!

"No. It's not that it wasn't interesting, though parts of this certainly weren't. It's not that something wasn't lost in translation, almost certainly something was. It was just boring. Too much pseudo-science talking page after page. Too many uninteresting and unsympathetic characters. Yes it was nice to see science fiction from China but I'd rather read good science fiction. There were bits near the end where it almost turned around, where I just barely began to care - about the situation, about the characters. But it didn't last.

"I read the book in Greek translation. Liu Cixin is fascinating. Through him you learn very interesting stuff about Chinese culture and political events of the Mao era in China. The author is able to blend a very sharp scientific mind with a rich imagination and also one can observe an undertone of lyricism, which is felt through the author's description of nature and humanity's relationship to it.
The plot is genuine and one can sense the emotional world of his main characters.

"The Jason Pettus 2020 Autumn Reading Challenge (join us!)
#11: A book currently being adapted into a movie or TV show

I had heard about this science-fiction novel here and there over the last several years, after its 2015 English translation officially became the first book in history to garner a Hugo Award for a native Asian author, and kicked off the whole meme about how we're currently living through the so-called ""Golden Age of Chinese Sci-Fi;"" but after Netflix recently announced a few weeks ago that they're making a brand-new high-profile adaptation of the entire ""Remembrance of Earth's Past"" trilogy (being co-produced by no less than the showrunners of , Brad Pitt, Rian Johnson, and Rosamund Pike), I thought it was finally time for me to read at least the first book of the trilogy myself and see if it's deserving of all its hype. And the answer, thankfully, is yes, yes it is!

I don't think it's a spoiler at this point to reveal that the book is centered around the concept of humans learning of the existence of extraterrestrial life for the first time, then quickly realizing that this far-advanced extraterrestrial life is currently on its way to Earth to invade us. But a lot of attention has been given to the conceit here that the first people to learn this information are Chinese scientists in the middle of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and '70s, one of the most shameful moments of the entire 20th century outside of the Holocaust itself, and a story concept that should at least inspire you to read , if like me you barely know anything about it. It's there that you'll learn that one of the hallmarks of the Cultural Revolution was that every single subject in human existence was forced to be parsed through the prism of far-left political ideology, so much so that even basic scientific facts were deemed to be ""untrue"" by Mao's homegrown army of radically liberal teenaged fanatics, since they came from ""Western Capitalists"" and therefore were inherently ""decadent"" and could not be trusted (a situation that , oh God please don't ""re-educate"" me, Wokes).

This is what's garnered the book so much attention in Western circles, the mere novelty of imagining a sci-fi story through the kinds of Eastern filters that are so unknown and new to us (including not just Maoist politics but a fair amount of ancient Chinese mythology too); and I was worried that when I read it myself, I was going to learn that this novelty is the one and only thing going for it, with it otherwise being just a so-so genre tale on its own merits. But thankfully this turned out to be much more interesting than that, a story that can hold itself up no matter what its background, because of its dual dedication to hard science and soft sociology. Namely, a huge chunk of this book is dedicated to a logical examination of the physics problem of the book's title, the idea that when three stars of varying sizes are locked in a gravitational orbit around each other, any poor planet that might be stuck between them (such as the homeworld of our invading aliens, for example) would be tossed and turned in such a chaotic and random way that it's virtually impossible for scientists to develop a stable prediction of where it would be knocked around next, leading in their case to a series of deadly hot and deadly cold seasons (some lasting for days, others for centuries) that essentially wipe out the entire ""Trisolaran"" species over and over and over, leading to a spiritual crisis by the 200th iteration in which they decide that their only remaining option is to abandon the planet for good, and go move permanently to the nearest habitable planet they can find (which unfortunately for us is Earth, located just four light years away).

But then the other big concept that Liu bandies about -- and frankly what I as a non-scientist found much more interesting -- is the way the human race might react if they actually do discover at some point in the future that extraterrestrial life exists. We pretend that it's going to be a unifying moment for all of humankind, either benign (as we collectively sob in awe of the universe's majesty) or malignant (as we collectively build a world army to combat the invaders). But what if it instead unleashes a planet-wide civil war that easily crosses national borders and socioeconomic levels, one that threatens to destroy the human race long before the aliens actually get here? What if millions of defeated, cynical intellectuals and environmentalists react to the news with, ""Good, let them invade us, humanity has proven itself to be worthless anyway, so they can't do any worse of a job running this planet than we have""? And what if these defeatists build their own army for the purpose of laying the groundwork for the coming alien invasion, precisely because their technology is so advanced that we can only perceive it through godlike religious terms?

It's essentially Liu taking the old joke of ""I for one welcome our new alien overlords"" then examining it in the most realistic, most terrifying way possible; and it's actually this development that drives most of the book's plot (or at least the first book; I haven't gotten to the other two yet). When you combine it, then, with this hard-science look at the coming aliens and why they're leaving, and the uniquely Chinese history and culture from which the whole story is filtered and presented, it results in a really unforgettable book, a dense and sometimes hard to follow story that I nonetheless devoured in three days of fevered, almost addicted eight-hour reading sessions. I can see why the dudes would be interested in this, because Liu presents some really flabbergasting mental images along the way of telling this story; but unlike a lot of Hollywood-friendly sci-fi tales, I can also see why the nerdiest nerds of the annual World Science Fiction Convention (aka ""Worldcon"") would award this the Hugo, because it's a grand return to the hard-science-based 1950s and '60s novels of such American Silver Age masters as Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke and Robert Heinlein (which shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with , in which all the way up to the 1990s it was still only these '50s Silver Age authors who were widely available to read in the first place).

I still suspect that this novel's overwhelming love and success is due more to the specific moment in history we're living through, and that writers like Liu and his Chinese peers will come to be thought of in another 20 or 30 years as just another group of interesting but not outstanding genre writers; but as long as we are living through this moment, I encourage Americans to take full advantage of it, and to enjoy this novel for exactly what it is, a chance to read a really ripping genre actioner but told from a cultural standpoint you're never experienced before. It's best thought of in these kinds of terms, as a decent story with a unique perspective instead of a mindblowing story just on its own; and those who can embrace this attitude will find a lot here that's worth your time and attention.

"Un libro muy top donde a mi me lo pintaban como super denso y que me iba a aburrir, no sé si habré sido yo o qué pero me ha encantado, hasta el punto de acabarmelo en 2 dias.

Me encanta todo el tema científico hasta lo más técnico y todo tan bien explicado, creo que lo mejor de un libro así es que te pueda parecer real aunque tenga su parte de ciencia ficción.

Lo que mas me ha gustado ha sido las reflexiones que te iba dejando el libro tanto de religiones, la importancia de la vida, los avances cientificos y sus consecuencias.

Para mi, ha sido un descubrimiento muy grato y que me deja con muchas más ganas de seguir sabiendo cosas porque obviamente lo deja todo muy abierto.

Recomendadísimo.

"Quizás deberían ser 4 estrellas, pero me apetecen las 5 mas por mi que por otra cosa. Por lo fresco que me ha parecido y porque me ha gustado bastante no saber nada de antemano y seguir sin saber que pasa durante mas de la mitad de la novela. Es por eso que esto va a estar libre de spoilers sobre que es lo que ocurre realmente en la trama. Me ha gustado descubrirlo por mi cuenta y desde luego, aunque te hagas conjeturas durante medio libro, cuando hay que poner las cartas encima de la mesa Cixin Liu, las pone, con focos, fanfarria y fuegos artificiales, por decirlo de alguna manera. Vamos que no se queda en medias tintas.

Ya el inicio es llamativo, con unos primeros capítulos situados durante la revolución cultural china y las persecuciones a los intelectuales, las brigadas rojas y las tropelías que ocurrieron en aquella época. Nunca se me habría ocurrido pensar en las relatividad de Einstein como reaccionaria y contrarrevolucionaria, pero para todo hay gente. Es en esa época convulsa donde conoceremos a una de las protagonistas y esa época servirá de base para toda su existencia.

Después pasamos a una época mas actual, donde algo está ocurriendo sin que sepamos qué. Igual que otro de los protagonistas, quien lleva una investigación de vanguardia sobre nanomateriales, nos iremos metiendo con él en una historia que no sabremos como encajar, sobre la que conjeturaremos y de la que obtendremos respuestas a su debido momento, no antes.

Muy peculiarmente escrito, o al menos, yo que no suelo leer autores chinos, me sorprendo con la forma de Cixin de describir y sobre todo de humanizar. Sin miedo de ir a las mas altas cotas de bizarrada de ciencia ficción, no pierde de vista que son personas normales a las que les ocurren las tramas y no cerebros sin dudas, sentimientos o caos interno.

Este es el primer libro de una trilogía, ya publicada completa tanto en china como en inglés en el resto del mundo y esto puede tomarse de dos maneras. Como que “3 cuerpos” es un prologo, o como una historia bastante completa, pero con una continuación interesante y amplia en el tiempo. Como no se si la segunda parte sigue la trama inmediatamente después, o si lo hace con otros personajes y años después, prefiero tomármelo como una novela bastante completa. Hay mas por ocurrir en esta historia, pero “la madre del cordero” queda expuesta aquí y bastante expuesta ademas, sin cortarse lo mas mínimo en irse de la olla. Como curiosidad, tanto al principio por no saber que ocurre como después al ver algunas motivaciones, me ha venido a la mente otro de los mas grandes libros de ciencia ficción que he leído, como es “Tejedores de Cabellos“… e incluso por la forma de humanizar y no caer en la extrema sobre explicación científica durante cientos de paginas. Vamos que para mi es ciencia ficción de la buena, picos altos de mindfuck pero sin olvidar que las personas son personas y que el caos es inherente a la vida, aquí y en el universo en general.

"Хареса ми, но останах и умерено разочарован. Знам си аз да не се пренавивам от хайп породен извън средите на системно четящите фантастика, но както и да е. Очаквах екстраполиране на идеи от ръба на съвременната наука и със закъснение видях, че новелата от която се е получил този роман е писана в края на миналия век, а научното знание от тогава е дръпнало в аритметична прогресия. Не смятам, че съм оставил този факт да повлияе на оценката ми, все пак съм любител на научната фантастика от по-стари периоди.
Две неща ще кажа, които малко опровергават горния абзац. Разтягането на протона в три, две и едно измерение беше точно такъв научен допуск, какъвто имаше нужда книгата. Другото е този социум изграден от научен елит, който честно казано ми се струва невъзможен, дори и с бунтарската цел, която му е зададена. ТОй и авторът го осзнава, за това решението тип Деус екс макина с дошлия случайно от Америка милярдер (а комбинацията от двете блъска толкова на загниващ късен социализъм, че изпаднах в умиление).
Малко ме напрегна виртуалната игра за трите тела. Ако изключим факта, че телата в задачата са четири - три слънца и планета - което не е беля, тя задачата с три тела е вариант на задача с n такива. По-големият проблем е, че всеки който е чел ""Играта на Ендър"" и нейните Загадки на великана няма как да се изненада, че на края на играда седи междовидов контакт. Другото - човешката изчислителна машина (ясно, че не е супер оригинална идея) ми беше едно към едно с разказа ""Играта"" на Анатолий Днепров (Има я в сборника ""Глиненият бог"" от библиотека Галактика, има го в читанката). Дори да предположим, че авторът не е чел руснака, то друидите във ""Фантастична светлина"" на Пратчет имаха подобен експеримент.
А, имаше един момент, когато китайския полицай обясняваше на натовските офицери, че не знаят мръсни номера. Човечецът явно не е чувал за опиумните войни, примерно.

Както и да е, това на страна, книжката беше интересна и като съдържание и като форма, Тези ретроспективни и виртуални моменти, които фрагментираха основната история, задочно знам, че са един типично китайски начин на разказване и беше интересно да се проследи.
Моментите с революцията, според мен бяха чист рекламен трик за продажба на запад, но може и да бъркам. Графичното насилие в книгата също го приех като нещо дълбоко китайско и добавящо екзотика.
Ще се четат и следващите часто, но не мога да повярвам, че това е най-доброто от милиард и половинен Китай, по-скоро е най-доброто, което може да се осмисли от западния читател според критиците. Което значи, че дълбоко подценяват мултикултурната смесица в която се превръща глобалното ни общество.

Aliens: Don't contact us, humanzzz. We will eat you!!!! :(

Humans: Hooooray! Hooooray! Fellow neighbors! Come visit us any time! We have nice fridges, Kim Kardashian, and have you seen da Tesla? Fancy! You can find us in Milky Way galaxy, The Solar System! Be our guest! Be our guest!

Well, I am 99% sure that you can get a degree in astrophysicist just by reading that. Fact are here. I don't know if I got a little smarter or there is something else, but somehow I had no troubles or problems with the scientific side of book. It conveys the info nicely. Everything is explained in more or less understandable way.



Also, it's different. I might be wrong, but it was the first sci-fi book I read by a Chinese author and a different point of view was very nice to experience. Author masterfully combines history, culture and dystopian fantasy. It's political, but considering current situation in China, it's understandable.

Buttttttt. I had a few problems with it. The very beginning of the book is very descriptive, dives deep into psychology of character development, science, history. The second half seems like written in flashes. Everything happens so fast, without proper attention. It might be the translation, but the aliens are called ""humans"" in one chapter when they are talking about their own race (page 333, Lithuanian translation) and I am not sure if homo sapiens are so popular in the universe to be everywhere. I am a firm believer that life forms will be shaped by the universe, planet they evolved in and Trisolarans seems way too human. There is no description of how they looks like, and I really missed some anthropology of their culture. If you Google them, they look mighty fine.

Olha gente, eu nem sei por onde começar, de verdade. Terminei o livro tem quase 1 semana e estava postergando pra escrever sobre, porque não quero relativizar nem pegar muito pesado.

O livro não é ruim, mas definitivamente não era pra mim, e não por ser sci fi ou por ser para um público mais adulto, enquanto eu normalmente leio livros para um público mais jovem. NÃO. O livro é absurdamente confuso, e não é exagero meu. Postei 2 parágrafos no meu Twitter e as pessoas ficaram tão chocadas quanto eu em como é uma confusão, além de ter alguns problemas chatíssimos de repetições infinitas de palavras iguais no MESMO parágrafo.

Eu confesso que sou suspeito porque odeio física e química, mas normalmente eu consigo ler livros sci fi e essas partes passam tranquilas por mim e não prejudicam meu entendimento, foi assim com a série Red Rising, com Perdido em Marte, etc. Perdido em Marte, inclusive, me deixou bem confuso, mas eu amei o livro do início ao fim, e queria ter amado este. A premissa é bastante interessante e em alguns momentos você começa a acreditar que ""agora vai"", e que a história vai desenrolar numa coisa legal, mas várias frentes são abertas e não são concluídas. O livro abre mil portas e não fecha todas. Ok que é uma série, mas é muito absurdo.

Quanto ao final, eu não posso dizer que odiei. Eu curti a história de Trissolaris, as partes que eram dentro do jogo, e a explicação de como seria um futuro provável na Terra depois dessa interação entre os 2 povos, mas é tudo tão confuso, e confesso, em algumas partes achei mal escrito, talvez seja um problema de tradução, que eu terminei o livro feliz que acabou. Sensação de ""graças a deus sobrevivi a isso"". Demorava 2 horas pra ler 50 páginas. Definitivamente não quero ter essa sensação lendo nada na vida. Problema nenhum com histórias densas, complexas, que exigem reflexão, mas aula super avançada de física, NÃO BRIGADA.

"The Three-Body Problem had an effect on me similar to Haruki Murakami's ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle"", and you only need to look at my Goodreads nickname to understand it's importance to me. Murakami and Cixin are different kinds of writers, but they both demonstrated a level of artistry and talent that I consider uncommon.

One element of The Three-Body Problem in particular just ""blew mah mind"", and that was the alien plan. I've seen advanced technology explained in hundreds of different ways in a sci-fi book, but never quite like this. The ability to describe such fantastic ideas is one matter, explaining them quite another. Then to both create, and explain such an idea with an interesting historical fiction, AND explore the depths of humanity on both a macro and microscopic level.

It's very hard to write tragic characters plausibly, and Liu has succeeded by rooting his protagonists in the Chinese Cultural Revolution. This setting is at once familiar, and tragic, further enhanced by Liu's excellent descriptions of the horrors that went on. I felt a strong emotional connection to all of the characters being swept up in the madness of the world. His characters are subtle but complex, real humans existing in a chaotic world.

As I have mentioned, the setting of Cultural Revolution-era China instantly pulled me in. I've always been interested in this period of time for a number of reasons. As a child, the first time I read about it, it scared me. I just couldn't imagine living in those circumstances. As an adult, it scares me even more, seeing the ""war on science and media"" being waged by factions of the American government, and it's supporters. As Liu wrote, ""...at that time when the ignorant often led the knowledgeable.."" The setting here created a sense of relevance and urgency.

I cannot wait to dig into the next book, so I'll end here. The Three-Body Problem is a book everyone should read, I think.

"The Three-Body Problem is the first book within the Remembrance of Earth's Past series. At first, things were slightly interesting but moving a snail's pace. It also doesn't help that I kept getting distracted by other things either. For example, work. Eventually things started to pick up and it made the pages fly by.

I'll admit that once we started to dive into scientific changes to planets and such, I felt like my eyes were getting a glazed look. Don't get me wrong, it was fascinating to see what could happen if they were altered in a way. Yet, scientific things don't always keep my attention. Science class was never my favorite when I was in school. I actually dreaded those classes.

Besides that, we do dive into some political stuff as well as speculations in human behaviors. Not sure if that would actually happen if this became real, but it was interesting to see how everything played out. I may, or may not, dive into the next book if I ever have time or an urging desire to do so.

In the end, it was interesting to a point, but the pace just threw me off.

"Qué libro tan interesante, muy diferente a lo que he leído últimamente, y eso me encanta porque me gusta cambiar de géneros y temáticas.
El inicio te atrapa al presentar una parte de la historia reciente de China y con ella se presenta al personaje central de la historia, la cual empieza desde ahí a desenredarse hasta el presente.
Es cierto que los personajes son algo planos y cuesta un poco empatizar con ellos. En cambio, la trama de ciencia ficción se va intensificando con un hilo conductor bastante coherente e interesante.
De paso, nos presenta cuestiones importantes a reflexionar sobre la naturaleza humana, el desarrollo de la ciencia y hacia dónde nos dirigimos como especie.
La lectura es ágil, los momentos de acción se suceden sin demasiado bombo y platillo, aunque algunos capítulos puntuales son un poco más lentos, quizá por el contexto (que no voy a spoilear)
Le daré un tiempo de descanso y me pondré sin duda con el segundo.

This book has a fascinating story but weak characterization. Most characters blend in and I couldn't tell one apart of the other at times. They could have been swapped for new characters and I wouldn't care or even notice. On the other hand, the story kept pulling me in with each page.

This isn't a book that will please everyone. It is hard (multiply that by 1000) sci-fi and it gets confusing when the science info dump happens. Did I understand everything? Big no. Did that dimish my enjoyment of the story? Not really. Did it make me think? Oh boy, that it did. I finished it last night but my mind keeps going back to it.

Because of the weak characterization and the heavy science content, I would not recommend an audiobook format for this one. I really think it needs to be read for it to be fully appreciated.

"No es un libro perfecto, pero recomiendo su lectura a toda persona humana

No es perfecto porque Liu Cixin utiliza a los personajes como simples recursos literarios para poder contar su historia. No les da profundidad, ni evolución ni se siente empatía alguna por ellos. Simplemente van de un lado a otro y ocurren cosas.

Pero claro, lo que ocurre es tan original, impactante y asombroso que merece la pena su lectura. La mezcla de ciencia, historia y el primer contacto extraterreste mejor narrado que he leído nunca hacen disfrutar de su lectura de principio a fin y consigue hacerte olvidar que quieras matar al protagonista cada tres páginas.

So much science! I am certain Liu wrote this in a lab coat. This all seemed legit, though I confess I’m no particle physicist. Cool ideas abound. The setting, during the Cultural Revolution parts of the book, was amazing. The story was pretty good, and I found the Panama scene horrifying. In a good way.

There might’ve been something lost in translation, because it read like a text book. The dialogue was awful, which made the characters feel flat.

The Three Body Problem, in my opinion, is up there with some of the best recently published works of science fiction and I have no problem in calling it an instant modern classic.

It successfully subverts the somewhat overly-familiar trope of aliens invading Earth and rather than have the human race fighting collectively against them, introduces themes of rivalling factions that seem all too – and disturbingly – familiar.

As a piece of hard science fiction, it introduces scientific concepts in a way that is cleverly told, through an original premise that doesn’t get lost in translation – despite the fact I suspect some parts actually are.

I enjoy reading books about other cultures, and I like sci-fi a lot, and I like to think that I'm good with hard(ish?) sci-fi, as long as there's a good story in there as well... but this one just didn't work for me on any of those levels. And sometimes I'm just too impatient to stick it out and wait for it to come together in the end. (OK, most of the time now, let's be honest. Life is just too short.)

I wish that I could say that I could appreciate what Liu Cixin was trying to do, but I didn't make it far enough to even know what that was. There were some cool ideas presented - the countdown clock was very intriguing - but all of the discussion around what was going on was SO hard mathy that I got very lost and ended up glossing over a lot of stuff... and then suddenly everything was very different and people were dehydrated husks and there was a quest and time wasn't timing anymore and I also just really did not love the audiobook reader. He was NOT the right choice for this.

And... so I just noped out.

I wish I could say that I was the right audience for this, but I'm not. I'm not smart enough or patient enough to see a book like this through, on that jumps around a lot and doesn't really explain anything as it goes (except in very deep theoretical physics-y ways).

So... 2 stars for the great book I'm sure this is... for someone else.

"Започнах тази книга след като изгледах сериала по Netflix, и след завършването й мога да кажа, че са се справили доста добре. Имаше много малки разлики откъм сюжет, които липсваха в сериала, но така тук ми бе още по-интересно. Определено ще продължа с четенето на трилогията!

"I don’t remember where I heard about this book, but I’m so glad I did. I even used up one of my coveted ‘not-on-my-to-read-list’ freebie books to read it. This book was a capital ‘E’ Experience.

*I’m only allowing myself twenty-five freebie books this year–books that aren’t on my 2015 TBR–because last year half the books I read were impulse reads and I barely made a dent in the books I meant to read. I’m sure this is a problem you’re all familiar with.

I’m a big sci-fi fan, but I’ve pretty much only read American sci-fi. Some British and Canadian authors have snuck in there, but that’s about it. It was a super interesting and jarring experience (in a good way) to read a science fiction book from a culture so unlike my own in history and values. Not just about a culture, but FROM IT. Since one of the main things science fiction does is to ingest culture and spit it back out in a form that allows us to interrogate our own beliefs, it was really, really fascinating to see what kinds of concerns Cixin Liu was interested in exploring about Chinese values (and world values as Chinese culture sees them).

Cixin Liu is China’s most popular bestselling science fiction author, and is the first book in his most popular trilogy, ‘Remembrance of Earth’s Past’ (which is being called Three-Body in English). The book begins just as China’s Cultural Revolution was getting started, and if you’re not familiar with that piece of history, you really need to read up on it at least a little bit before you read this book. It’s central to understanding a lot of the between the lines stuff, and why characters act the way they do that might seem really foreign to Westerners specifically. It would be like trying to understand American behavior without knowing anything about the history of slavery and the Civil War, or trying to understand Scottish history without knowing about the Jacobite Rebellion, just two pull two examples off the top of my head.

From the blurb:



From there, all you really need to know is aliens are coming, and they are prepping us for their arrival. Weird shit starts happening. Scientists start killing themselves. A countdown appears in a man’s field of vision. The universe flickers. The central question the novel asks is whether the threat of alien invasion will unite us as a species, or whether it will tear us apart even faster.

The only ‘issue’ (for lack of a better word) I had with this book is that one of the main characters was so thinly drawn. He was essentially a pair of eyes for us to see the story through. It also didn’t help that every character around him were exactly the opposite: rich, complicated characters with arcs and faults and personalities, especially the character of Ye Wenjie, a politically ostracized scientist who is deep into the alien happenings. Her arc is the perfect example of personal, emotionally affecting character work expanded large onto a scope of terrifying science fiction ideas.

Every sci-fi fan should read this. It is terrifying and thought-provoking and unsettling, and really, really interesting. Can’t wait for the translations of books two and three.

"First thought upon finishing: occasionally I read a book, and think wow, what a great idea. I could have got a whole book out of the first fifty pages of that. Thank god for you, Author, and how far you take your ideas.

I'm thinking of Lathe of Heaven right now, as I did several times while listening to : less because of content or outlook, and more because of the sheer vastness of the storytelling. Such scope; such range. At any rate, I am always thrilled to find it, and this time I demolished it with gusto.

-------

After a year of slowly getting my head around it, I think I finally understand why audiobooks are having the surge in popularity they're currently getting. I don't know whether I would have given this five stars in paperback format, but as it was, the fifth star is for Luke Daniels and his wide range of accents, paces, and intonations.

The remaining four stars are for Liu's own writing, which for me represents the very best things about science fiction, the things that set it apart from other genres. The speculative boundary-pushing that goes on in this novel is just glorious, I wanted to speed the tape up and shovel it into my brain with both hands. The optimism of his outlook, his attitude towards the world and the universe and knowing things - they're what makes fiction by and for scientists just sparkle for me. I love it.

concentrates on three things, and if you're interested in or would like to know about any of them, then this book is definitely for you. Those three things are:

(1) The Chinese Cultural Revolution - which I knew nothing about, but found absolutely fascinating;
(2) The history of science across the globe and across human civilisation - which, give me all of it, put it in my face; and
(3) How scientific knowledge and the survival of individuals and species interact. If you're here for the sci-fi, I hope you're here for that.

In short, it's the sort of book where I go, ""Of course that's exactly what I want to read."" How well it's executed almost doesn't matter; I just want someone to take those ideas and parade them around in front of me, then smash them together and show me what they find. For his ideas alone, Liu is on my list of authors of whose works I will read everything in a language I understand. I'll follow him wherever he goes. Because this is what science fiction is .

Luckily it's also very well-executed. I know some people thought a few of the characters were drawn in quite broad brush-strokes. That was fine by me: of the main characters, Wang Miao is a welcome reader-insert and Ye Wenjie is meant to be inscrutable.

(Da Shi was my favourite. If Da Shi was not your favourite too, you may have some explaining to do.)

Let's talk about why the world needs more non-Anglo-American sci-fi - or at least why I do. There's a New Yorker interview with Cixin Liu from just after he won the Hugo this year, where he quotes the Chinese poet Xu Zhimo on his return from the Soviet Union at some point in (I think? quoting this from memory/my commonplace book) the 1930s, and it goes:



There's something so different in that, compared with what I'm used to. I want sci-fi that talks about creating rather than regaining; building from scratch from viewpoints that don't have that same post-colonialist well-we-screwed-it-up-last-time look over their shoulders. I'm bored of X or Y But In Space; I'm bored of knowing winks to individual works or endless tangled webs of canon; and I'm especially bored of the idea that ""The Golden Age"" - whatever that is, and whichever genre we're talking about - is in the past.

That optimism for the unknown or the yet-to-come thrills me. Links to someone else's past with someone else's attitudes and emotions, they make me tingle.

So read this book. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm pretty sure have some N. K. Jemisin to read.

"Думал, что бы почитать из hard sf, остановился на Цысине Лю. Модный китайский автор твердой НФ, передовой мыслитель, миллионные тиражи на родине и на западе, статуэтка ""хьюго"", наконец. Казалось бы, что здесь может пойти не так?

Ха ха, правильный ответ - ВСЕ.

Когда китаец начал рассказывать про инопланетян с Проксимы Центавра, которые все такие высокоразвитые, но их миллионолетняя цивилизация не может тупо обсчитать орбиту своей планеты в системе из трех солнц, потому что ЗАДАЧА ТРЕХ ТЕЛ НЕ ИМЕЕТ РЕШЕНИЯ - я почувствовал, что здесь что-то неладно.

Короче, центавриане весь свой миллион лет претерпевают ужасные лишения, потому что у них то день, то ночь, то жара, то холод, а то одно из солнц подлетает слишком близко и ЛЮДИ С ЗЕМЛИ НАЧИНАЮТ ПАДАТЬ ВВЕРХ В СОЛНЦЕ И СГОРАТЬ (не шучу). Чтобы спастись от этой напасти, они придумывают хитрый план - построить огромные радиотелескопы и слушать небо, авось где-нибудь рядом появится достаточно развитая техническая цивилизация, тогда мы услышим их передачи, сразу туда полетим, всех убьем, займем планету и будем жить припеваючи. А если никто поблизости не сподобится вещать в радиодиапазоне в нашу сторону, ну что поделать, не изучать же ближайшие системы самим, это суетно, лучше претерпевать и гибнуть.

К счастью, тут они ловят сигнал с Земли и немедля выступают в военный поход! Но есть проблема - до Земли лететь 400 лет, за это время земляне наверняка технически разовьются до неописуемых высот и встретят горе-завоевателей (которые всего-то миллион лет развивались) крепкими тумаками. Надо остановить технический прогресс на Земле! Сказано-сделано, злодеи берут обычный протон, разворачивают его в 11 измерениях (что бы это ни значило), паяют на получившейся гигантской поверхности бессчетное число микросхем и сворачивают обратно в форму протона! И пуляют его с околосветовой скоростью к Земле.

Долетев, умный протон развивает подрывную деятельность. Вначале он проникает в ускорители частиц и портит атомщикам все опыты. От этого ведущие физики по всему миру начинают сходить с ума и выпрыгивать из окон с криком ""физика не работает, мне незачем больше жить"" (не шучу). Сатанинский протон также поддает жару астрономам, заставляя реликтовое излучение мерцать азбукой Морзе; но этот его план терпит крах, потому что астрономы при виде такого чуда просто пожимают плечами (не шучу!!) и идут пить чай, ну типа, реликтовый фон мерцает, ну и пускай его, у нас обеденный перерыв. В приступе бешенства протон начинает писать выжившим физикам прямо на сетчатке глаза буковки ВЫ ЖАЛКИЕ ЧЕРВЯКИ АХХА ХА ХАХА (не шучу!!!)

В качестве вишенок на торте идут детективные сцены, где, например, захваченную у террористов бомбу ВЗВЕШИВАЮТ НА БЕЗМЕНЕ, чтобы выяснить, не атомная ли она, а патрульный мент Вася приглашен в мировые советы по спасению Земли, но рядом с могучим потоком идиотии основного сюжета это все практически уже и неважно.

"Nauji metai taip stuktelėjo galvon, kad gautą dovanų čekį sumąsčiau išleisti išbandant kažką naujo. Šiuo atveju, tai reiškė pabandyti fantastikos žanrą, nes kodėl ne. Blogiausiu atveju tai bus tik dar viena knyga mano lentynoje. Fantastika nesidomiu, jos neskaitau, bet jau ne pirmą kartą ši knyga šmėsteli ir vis su puikiais atsiliepimais. Prisiekę fantastikos mėgėjai ją liaupsina, tai pagalvojau, kad nuo ko geriausia būtų pradėti pažintį su nauju žanru, jei ne nuo ""Trijų kūnų problemos"".

Knygos autorius Liu Cixinu yra daugkartinis įvairių fantastikos literatūros premijų laureatas. Tarp jų ir Hugo premiją už ""Trijų kūnų problemą"", knygą, apie kurią dabar kalbame. Liu Cixinu yra lyginamas su tokiais autoriais kaip Orwell ir, turiu, pripažinti, kad pirmieji knygos puslapiai būtent tokį vaizdą ir sudarė - Goerge Orwell pakeitęs kryptį ir pasinešęs į fantastiką. Liu domina tokios temos kaip socialinė nelygybė, mokslo vystymas, ekologijos problematika.

""Trijų kūnų problema"" - pasakojimas, kuris mus nukelia į Kiniją. Čia vyksta kultūrinė revoliucija. Slapta organizacija bando užmegzti ryšį su kitomis civilizacijomis kosmose. Gaunamas atsakymas, kuris suskaldo ir taip nevieningą žmoniją - vieni nori kariauti su galimais užkariautojais, kiti juos priimti.

Skaityti pradėjau didelėmis akimis ir su šiokia tokia baime. Fantastika man nauja ir bijojau, kad nieko aš čia nesuprasiu. Bet nebuvo taip baisu kaip tikėjausi. Skaičiau gana lengvai ir, kaip jau minėjau, pradžia priminė Orwell, kuris jokia paslaptis - skaitosi lengvai. Taigi visiškai palengva ir su malonumu panirau į Cixinu sukurtą fantastikos pasaulį. Aišku, čia daug fizikos ir dar visokių mokslų, bet turint bent šiokius tokius mokslo pagrindus tikrai skaityti galima. Žinoma, ne viską aš supratau, bet gal tame irgi yra šiek tiek žavesio. Pastebėjimas būtų toks - šioje knygoje daug dalykų, kurie aktualūs dabar ir bus aktualūs dar n metų, tik, mano nuomone, apie juos kalbama perkeliant į tą fantastinę erdvę. Bet tai nebuvo fantastika dėl fantastikos. Mintis čia gana gili ir man patiko, kad ji apskritai buvo, nes to nesitikėjau. Suprantu, kad gal skambu kiek juokingai, bet noriu būti iki galo atvira. Tikėjausi tiesiog fantastikos pasakojimo su ateiviais ar kažkuo pan, o gavau daug gilesnį ir prasmingesnį pasakojimą.

Išvada - pirmas blynas tikrai nebuvo prisvilęs ir džiaugiuosi, kad ėmiausi skaityti šios knygos. Visai tikėtina, kad norėsiu perskaityti ir likusias trilogijos dalis, nes ""Trijų kūnų problema"" yra tik pirmoji dalis. Į pabaigą šiek tiek sunkiau sekėsi susigaudyti, bet patyrimas tikrai įdomus. Be to, labai noriu paskatinti ir savo sekėjus išbandyti naujus žanrus, nebijoti, neužsiblokuoti nuo jų - tikrai geras jausmas imti ir pabandyti tai, kas neįprasta.

"DNF @ 70%

but i'm totally counting it as read because i made myself suffer a lot to get to this point and i'm not throwing all of my progress away.

the plot started out interesting, but it kept dragging and dragging and i couldn't fool myself into thinking i was still interested in it. we follow two main characters - one in present day and one in a few flashbacks, reminiscing of the cultural revolution days - and the present day character, called Wang Miao, was simply a cardboard cutout. he had absolutely no personality, nothing that made him stand out, and i didn't even hate him because he was so insipid. i just... didn't feel anything.

Ye Wenjie, on the other hand, who was the focus of the flashback chapters, was awesome. i loved her and honestly if this book had been all about her journey, from her days as a young adult watching her father die at the hands of the red guard, to her future as an academic in china, even if it didn't include the aliens, i'd probably read the whole thing. unfortunately, Wenjie had to share her time in the spotlight with Wang Miao, who was the worst.

seriously. the worst.

other than boring-ass characters, the pacing of this was completely uneven. NOTHING would happen for hundreds of pages; then, suddenly, there were loads of twists. (all of the interesting ones happened during Wenjie's chapters, btw. because she's the only worthy one.) if i cared even a little bit about the plot itself, this wouldn't have been a problem, but i kept expecting the aliens i was promised and they were just never there. there's a lot of talk about physics and its concepts, and then some talk about computers, and then more physics. but not aliens. i just wanted the goddamned ALIENS!!!

and, finally, there's the matter of the writing. it was stiff and unremarkable, and the dialogues were strange. but this is not something i'm holding against this novel because i think this is just a characteristic of eastern asian languagues; they're often very formal and stiff, and i don't think there was much the translator could've done about it without losing the essence of the novel itself. it's just not something that i found pleasing to read.

this is honestly more of a 1.5 rating, if i'm being honest. the extra half star is Ye Wenjie's merit alone. this was the first book i picked up in 2017 and sadly it's also my first dnf of the year, but hopefully i'll have better luck with my next SF pick!

"Il problema delle idee

Mi sono trovata parecchio in difficoltà nel valutare questo libro. Ho apprezzato la cornice narrativa, l'originalità delle idee e l'approccio ai temi fantascientifici da una prospettiva orientale ma, altrettanto, alcuni intrecci e soluzioni e lo spessore dei personaggi non sono stati a mio parere all'altezza dell'architettura complessiva. Questa la ragione delle salomoniche tre stelle assegnate. Quando leggo il testo di uno scrittore asiatico cerco sempre, per quanto mi è possibile, di sgomberare il campo da ogni aspettativa convenzionale, date le premesse culturali divergenti frutto di patrimoni artistici, filosofici e spirituali evoluti in correnti distinte. Il significato inscritto nella linearità di un gesto può, per esempio, risultare intraducibile per il nostro sfaccettato universo emotivo ma rintoccare di un'eco che trova radici profonde nella tradizione artistica orientale, che ne legittima e influenza la funzione estetica e narrativa. Fatte salve queste riflessioni, che ho cercato di tenere presenti, mentre la prima parte del libro sembra poter decollare verso uno sviluppo innovativo e affascinante e le personalità abbozzate dei personaggi hanno ancora possibilità di evolvere e stratificarsi, anche grazie ad ampie incursioni nello storico della Cina maoista che potrebbero amplificarne i tratti in termini di profondità e complessità, la seconda invece affonda in un crescendo confuso di spunti elaborati, pre-finiti e incoerenti come pasti precotti senza la lista degli ingredienti, accompagnati dal declino dei caratteri dei protagonisti che lentamente si spengono in una fissità unidimensionale. La parte conclusiva, infine, precipita del tutto in un abisso di barocchismi fantascientifici e grossolane banalizzazioni che ho trovato francamente incomprensibili e irritanti, considerato l'indubbio valore di alcune idee e intuizioni iniziali. La sensazione ultima è quella di aver letto due libri diversi. Ecco, il problema delle idee è che da sole non bastano.

"2.5/5

Right, where to begin with this?

I wanted to love this. I expected to love this. Unfortunately I just didn't quite get the overall hype for this. I just want to start off with saying that the final act of this book is remarkable, it really is. The last third of this book absolutely warrants the hype and praise that The Three Body Problem has been receiving. But for the first two thirds I just didn't get it. I wasn't captivated and I wasn't invested in Wang Miao, one of the two primary main characters, as a character - there was no emotional connection there. Conversely, Ye Wenjie, the other primary character is a lot more interesting. Sadly, the most we see and learn of her is in the books final act.

The main offender for me were the scenes set in the virtuality reality world of Three Body, which is where the book gets its titular namesake. This is one of the parts I was expecting to love. We were delving into a new world to learn about but nearly everything that happened in the world of Three Body just went completely over my head and at times almost felt esoteric. That said, a lot of the world of Three Body is explained in the final act of the book, but that particular pay off wasn't satisfying for me because instead of coming off as mysterious and intriguing, the VR world just felt confusing to me.

This book very much feels like the first of a series. Just unfortunately, the first two thirds just seem like setup upon setup for the books final act and later books.

Negatives aside, this is a very, very intelligent and articulate book. The final third really begins to start cooking on gas, finally moving the plot forward in a spectacular and exciting way. Also, some very important philosophically profound questions are asked, with some fascinating dualing opinions. The Three Body Problem touches down on some very important real world subjects and concerns in an exceptionally satisfying way. The books final act is 5 stars, the rest sadly is not.

This is a very well written book with excellent themes, it's just a shame we have to wait until the books final act to see the books truly good stuff. However, the setup for the rest of the trilogy is firmly established now and I have faith that I will very much love the rest of this series.

"Risible, poor, full of boring characters, boring plot developments and stupidity overall, ""The Three-Body Problem"" is a clear example of how difficult is to write good sci-fi that makes sense and is interesting in this world we live right now in.

The story jumps between the 60s, with a 'secret secret' Chinese project in the middle of nowhere (an overlong, boring part, full of stupid characters) and the present, where all scientists seem to be killing themselves (because; in a plot development that really never makes sense), a mysterious organization is trying to do something really mysterious (really?, the most ridiculous organization ever, with some characters' decisions that will make you roll your eyes constantly) and a 'very interesting' video-game exists (a laughable thing that fills pages, is boring as hell, and just seems to be there for Liu Cixin to show his knowledge of science and philosophy; and maybe for all those people that like video-games?).

The typical first encounters with other 'races' from far away in the universe are a typical in sci-fi (as the machines' uprising, for example), and Liu Cixin does nothing to break from the pack. That his characters are cardboard cut, with the same depth as a two-dimensional proton, or that their decisions make no sense (I kill you, I invite you to this meeting, we use this video-game to convince the middle and low classes, but only intellectuals like it...) seem to be of no importance to him. His plot decisions are poor, and the writing style (in this translation) is poor, very poor, with zero rhythm and no knowledge of what pace is. And if that was not enough, there is a pedantic tone all throughout the novel, with all the intellectuals comments or the ones about humanity. (I can understand some cultural aspects, but it is funny how this is China and USA, with a cameo by Japan).

The best are the 'educational' moments, where science (nothing Liu Cixin has created) shows its face (as the eleven dimensions, string theory, etc).

Poor, very poor effort.

"Addendum: Having watched the show now, I have to say (as it normally does with sci-fi) the moving pictures far outshines the written word, although I will say I'm very pleased someone did pick up this book (series) & turn it into a TV adaptation!



Been after this book for a while & managed to finally track down a copy....... would it be worth the trouble?

The cover of the book gives a hint to the backdrop which is what drew me to the text in the first place...... the first 100 pages are anything & everything but though, as we’re transported back 40 years to a China of 1967 where a good part plays out..... Im lost but still going on....... then it’s about scientists & theories & non-theories too...... where’s it all going at this point? Where’s those scenes from the cover of the book?

I don’t like to give much away & in this case would ruin the majority of the story so i’ll jus say....... Its split into three storylines – The Red Coast - which is the past & based on a secret weapons establishment & is very scientific & teccy for me & not very interesting at times but it does give insight into the plot so you have to plough through even if there’s a little skipping at times – The game called the Three Body - which gets very bogged down at times, its clever no doubt but a little too clever for this reader & found it for the most part staid but again its central to the plot...... & - The now which I enjoyed the most as the characters were engaging & lively with a pacy story.

It was a real mixed bag of a read, a good story ruined at times by a lot of tech heavy narrative. it reminded me in many ways of the Yellow Blue Tibia of Adam Roberts albeit it didn’t work as well as that book did, being at times very staid (maybe lost in the translation?).....

As for the mark? I’m going with a middle of the road three but in truth it dips frequently to a two & only very occasionally peaks with a four. It’s a trilogy that I may well never finish, perhaps i’ll wait for the film?

"Geez, I really wanted to love this ... I really did ... and, yet, in the end, I didn't. That doesn't mean I didn't find it interesting, but I surely didn't find it compelling or captivating, and, to some extent, I fear that I loaded it down, simply burdened it, with too many expectations that just couldn't be met.

I first started this book years ago, ... then I stopped and put it down. Over the years, whenever a friend or a kindred spirit would glowingly, effusively recommend it, I'd start again.... And sometimes I'd progress a little further.... but it never really grabbed me. None of the characters resonated with me, nor did any come alive....

This time ... this year ... I decided to stick with it. I even bought a paper copy so it was harder to forget about than something I originally started on my Kindle.... And, while I ultimately found it interesting ... and creative ... I can't think of a single time that I sat and read it, uninterrupted, and didn't want to put it down. Conversely, I put it down at the end of every chapter (and often leafed ahead so I knew how many more pages I had to read before the chapter break) ... and sometimes in the middle of a chapter.... And I took it with me on multiple trips (I can't count the number of planes in which I tried, but ...), and didn't finish it....

Among other things, I was disappointed by how the Chinese aspects (the history, the culture, the politics) of it failed to grab me. I've spent a fair amount of time (and I'm guessing far more than most readers) in the country, and I've really enjoyed working, traveling, and, of course, eating there....

It's not the first Hugo winner I didn't love, and I'm confident it won't be the last.

But, now, I'm done with it. I'm glad I read it ... and yes, again, I don't disagree that it's creative and interesting and thought-provoking ..., and now I can discuss it (relatively intelligently) with others.... But I don't see myself recommending it.

Alas.

Both the ocean and the iceberg are made of the same material. That the iceberg seems separate is only because it is in a different form. In reality, it is but a part of the vast ocean.…”


I've put off reading this for a while because for some reason I decided that it seems like a novel that would be too complicated or too dense... I was obviously wrong. This is amazing. This is one of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read and I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.

The beautiful thing about is how well it's able to blend science and dynamic storytelling. There are plenty of scientific concepts and theories discussed, but this is done in a way that's easy to understand and crucial for the plot. It's honestly brilliant. While characters can definitely take a backseat to the story and the ideas behind the novel, there's still enough there for me to get invested in a few of them. And the way the alien civilization is portrayed here... well, no spoilers, but I cannot wait to know more.

I don't want to make big claims too soon, before I've read the other two books, but has some serious potential to become one of my all-time favorite book series at the moment.

Необходимо е малко време насаме с англоезичната фантастика, за да навлезеш в проблематиката и търсенията на тамошните писатели. Дотолкова сме свикнали с нея. Но с китайската е по-различно, не само защото се случва достатъчно рядко да бъде превеждана на български, за да я разберем. Китайската история е древна и пълна с любопитни събития чак до съвремието, затова я има тази специфична нотка, когато „външен“ се опита да навлезе и разбере този особен свят на династии и открития. С издаването на „Трите тела“ („Колибри“, 2020, с превод на Стефан Русинов) интересът определено би се засилил. А и точно тази книга никак не е случайна. Ако решаването на Задачата за трите тела е достатъчно сложна за масовия читател на научна фантастика, си трябва точно един Лиу Цъсин, за да направи нещата пределно разбираеми и любопитни. За мен книгата си беше необикновено изживяване и с удоволствие бих препоръчал да надникнете, пък макар и с разбираемото напоследък съмнение. Само ще кажа, че намесата на Културната революция на Мао Дзедун, с цялата си невъзможност, доставя онази пъстра добавка, за да направи от историята нещо специално.

"Aunque hay partes del libro, decisiones del autor y formas de contar ciertas cosas con las que no estoy demasiado contento, aparte del hecho de que hay ciertos conceptos que me sobrepasan, en conjunto este libro me ha volado la cabeza.

No se puede contar gran cosa del libro sin destripar partes importantes, así que lo dejo ahí, simplemente diré que aunque al principio no lo parezca el libro simplemente utiliza como excusa una de las temáticas más típicas de las historias clásicas de ciencia ficción para ofrecernos un relato sorprendente y lleno de ideas originales.

Liu Cixin nos ofrece una mirada a la historia reciente de China, adentrándonos en la vida de una astrofísica que sufrió persecución durante la revolución cultural, por otro lado tenemos la línea principal en la que un científico que investiga sobre nanomateriales empieza a presenciar fenómenos inexplicables que le inducen a detener su investigación.

Como digo aunque le veo fallos el libro me ha sorprendido y me ha gustado lo suficiente como para darle 5 estrellas y ponerlo en favoritos, a ver si puedo seguir pronto con la saga que promete mucho en los siguientes libros.

"This was my favorite sci-fi book I’ve read in the past few years.

The writing was very good. It had parts where it zoomed into detailed scientific topics (well frankly it could be just pseudo-science jargon, I wouldn’t really be able to tell) where if that’s your jam you can totally nerd out. But, it would never get too lost in the weeds, as it always zoomed back out to a more fundamental mystery story that was fun to read.

The book intersects with philosophy and politics, having themes that were fun to think about and layers I look forward to exploring more on re-reading. It was written by a Chinese author, and while I don’t have a good understanding of how censorship works in China, I was surprised to see so many sections that were obviously very critical of the authoritarian regime.

The translation seems excellent; I never felt like I was missing something important and in fact it was never top of mind as I was reading that it was a translation.

I’m definitely convinced to read the sequels and I’ll be watching the Netflix version that is scheduled to come later this year.

"Cixin Liu’s The Three-Body Problem is, at its best, complex and intriguing. With its rich historical perspective, the inventiveness of The Three-Body Problem surprises. Liu convincingly portrays his central three characters. The Three-Body Problem is also, at its worst, overly complicated and difficult to follow, peopled with some wooden secondary characters.

I rarely read science fiction: I prefer character and plot driven fiction, rather than fiction driven by scientific imagining and speculation. But is thought-provoking and imagination-stimulating overall, and worth whatever frustrations it may cause readers.

В училище ми беше изключително трудно по математика, не я разбирах тази наука, аз си имах нотите още от 6 годишна...после физиката ме досмачка: формули и безсмислени изчисления на задачи и закони...в един момент, в 11 клас се появи астрономията и ми беше интересна, но от ""романтичната"" гледна точка - звезди, съзвездия, космос, млечен път, необятно красиво пространство, в което може би има и друга форма на живот...религия и наука се сблъскаха и тук се появява явно астрофизиката...
Връщам се на Трите тела...ами...това просто си е шедьовър. Не случайно изчаках да си взема всички части преди да се гмурна в това междузвездно пътуване и да открия още един писател, който те кара да мислиш за всичко извън дребното и сиво ежедневие...много проблеми поставя тази книга, дори не искам да ги започвам...
И в крайна сметка какво се оказа, че след около 4 века ще дойдат извънземни за да ни унищожат? 🤣 Яко🤣 (в кръга на маетапа).
Интересно е, че винаги чакаме някой друг, или външна сила да влети от някъде и да оправи обърканият ни живот...буболечки...наистина сме такива...

"No sabía qué esperar de este libro, pero al final ha acabado gustándome muchísimo.

Es un poco complicado reseñar El problema de los tres cuerpos, porque las aproximadamente 400 páginas que lo componen son tan dinámicas que, de un capítulo a otro, la historia pasaba de ensayo de astrofísica a tratado de antropología, pasando por partes en las que parecía que estaba leyendo un thriller, mezcladas con otras en las que el autor hacía una fuerte denuncia social.
Creo que lo que más me gustó fue que la importancia de la ciencia como motor de la evolución del ser humano, fuera el eje principal de la historia.

Como comentaba, es un libro bastante complejo, que me hacía pararme constantemente a reflexionar sobre la cantidad de asuntos que trata, pero al mismo tiempo el autor aboga por un estilo narrativo muy sencillo y ligero, que pese a estar lleno de términos técnicos, en ningún momento me resultó pesado.

Los personajes que dan vida a la trama son de lo más variados, y me gustó especialmente el de Ye Wenjie, por ser totalmente atípico a lo que vengo leyendo últimamente (siguiendo un poco la estela del propio libro). No quiero comentar mucho sobre ella para no revelar detalles importantes de la trama, pero me ha parecido fascinante encontarme ante un personaje tan real y particular.
Sí que es verdad que quizá me ha faltado algo más de desarrollo en algún que otro personaje, pero en líneas generales me ha gustado mucho, y tengo muchas ganas de ponerme con el siguiente de la trilogía, para ver por dónde lleva Cixin Liu la historia.

"The Three-Body Problem was originally written in Chinese and has been translated to English. I read the English translation, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The story had its quirks, but it held my interest well. One of the fun aspects was definitely getting a little taste of Chinese culture and history, since I know appalling little about China. The translator has added a few footnotes to help explain cultural references that wouldn’t make sense to many readers from other countries, and the author also had a few footnotes to explain some science concepts. The book wasn’t overloaded with footnotes; there were 35 in all and they helped add some clarity to the story.

This is one of those books where, early on, you are given a lot of questions and then the answers are slowly revealed throughout the book. This makes it difficult to describe the plot in any detail without spoiling all of the fun of seeing everything revealed for oneself. I’m going to confine myself to describing one of the first plot elements that started the string of questions: something is going on with scientists throughout our world. Many of them are committing suicide.

This is more of a plot-driven book than a character-driven book. The characters were interesting and believable, but this was not a book where I became really invested in the characters. The story was the real draw. I did think there were some aspects of the plot that didn’t really fit together correctly. One of the larger issues I had will have to be described within spoiler tags…



This is the first book in a trilogy, and it doesn’t really resolve anything. It does not end in a cliff hanger though, and it answered all the main questions brought up throughout the story. It left me very curious about what will happen next, so I plan to jump right into the second book.

"I tried going into this novel as blind as I could. I knew from seeing some reviews from my goodreads friends in the past that this book involved aliens. It’s been quite a while since I last seen those reviews and I started to doubt myself if what I remembered was true and I wanted to avoid reading the blurb. The reason I started to doubt myself is because the first part of this book was really… strange? It was really hard to anticipate what this book was going to be about, but not in a way where you feel completely lost. Yeah, I had no idea what I was reading until everything was revealed in the second part, but even when I was clueless this book was way too entertaining. I don’t know how Liu Cixin managed it but every sentence was drawing me more and more into this book and I just couldn’t put it down. I also have to give credit to Ken Liu, there was no page, no sentence, no word that made me feel like this was a translation.
I mentioned that the first part of this book was strange, mostly because I had no idea what was happening but also because of the science. Some of it is real and some of it is made up and at times even silly (like the human computer) but even in those moments I didn’t have to suspend my disbelief because the writing made it work. If the first part of this novel was confusing but a pleasure to read, the second part was where everything started to make sense and it was scary. It’s been some time since a book made me feel so much dread and I’m still afraid of what the next book has in store.

"Ödüllü kitaplara hep çekinceli yaklaşırım. Nedense benim kitap zevkimle o ödülü verenlerinki bir türlü uyuşmuyor. Bu kitaba dört ve beş yıldız verenlerle de uyuşmamış belli ki. Yorumlardan ""aslında ben de pek beğenmedim ama ayıp olmasın""ı sezdim biraz :)

Bu kitabı daha iyi anlamak için önce bir Çin sosyolojisi ve tarihi, ardından da fizik çift ana dal yapmanızı tavsiye ederim. Aslında kitabın konusu gayet başarılı ancak kurguda sıkıntılar var. Üstüne bir de karakterlerin adına ve cinsiyetine aşina olmayışımız gelince işler iyice sarpa sarıyor. Mesela şöyle bir cümle var: ""Wang arabasına bindi ve Yang Dong'un annesini gormek icin Ding Yi'nin verdiği adrese gitti"". Bir de nene-torun oldu mu işler iyice Dark'a sardı. Neyse.

Kitabın neredeyse ortasına kadar bilim kurgu değil, tarih ağırlıklı olarak gidiyor. Konuya da hakim olmayınca yazarın alıştığımız bilim kurgu örüntüsünden farklı yazım stili biraz sıkılmaya sebep oluyor. Çanak anten ve geriye sayım Lost benzeri bir heyecan uyandırmaktan uzak. Aksiyon neredeyse hiç yok. Sürpriz de yok. O zaman ne var?

Bol bol fizik var. İngilizcesi ""three-body problem"" olan ""üç cisim problemi"" aslında hala çözülememiş bir fizik kuramı (). Burayı zaten okusam bile bir TM'ci olarak anlamadım. Wang abi VR'dan bunu anladı ancak açık söyleyeyim belirli kalıpların içinde düşünmeye alışmış olan ben bu VR sistemini de sevemedim. Yani bu bir oyunsa herkeste farklı olmaz, başı sonu bellidir değil mi? Yani işin VR tarafı da bana zorlama geldi. Cliffhanger güzeldi ama kalan kitapları okuma isteği ve merağı açısından bana yetmedi.

Özetle Ursula teyzenin erken kitapları gibi 60'larda yazılsaydı gerçekten hayalgücüne hayranlık duyup dört yıldız vereceğim ancak 2000'lerin başında artık daha fazla beklentiye sahip olduğum için, bir ordan bir buradan kronolojik sırayla ilerlemeyen kitaplara antipatim ve üzerine ağır bir de ağır fizik geldiği için bayılmadığım bir kitaptı. Yine de bana bakmayın çoğunluk ölüp ölüp bitmiş.

Herkese keyifli okumalar!

"I have waited awhile before writing a review of this book. Initially,when I finished it, I felt the book deserved 5 stars--and, after due consideration, I think it still merits my rating of 5 stars. The main reason is that it is a strong science fiction story and I have been a big fan of SF since I began reading and looking for SF books in my school and local public libraries. And it's hard SF, my favorite, comparable to work done by authors such as David Brin and Kim Stanley Robinson, two of my favorites. In fact, it's such hard SF that I don't think I understand it, dealing, as it does with quantum entanglement. But who does understand it? Is it possible to understand it? As Arthur C. Clarke put it, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" Discussion of things like ""the three-body problem"" were a real challenge and definitely not a turn-off, and I appreciated that challenge.
What clinched 5 stars for me was the fact that the book was written by a Chinese person, from a Chinese and non-Western perspective. That made it especially interesting to me as almost all the science fiction I have read has been by Americans, Canadians, British, French, and some other Europeans ( and not to forget the Australians!). I also have to say the translator, Ken Liu, did an awesome job of translation. As he said in his postscript, he tried to do a translation that does not read as if the book was originally written in English. I did get that feeling from the book.
Finally, the book was a very interesting story about human-alien contact, one of my favorite themes in SF and, of course, one that has been done over and over. But I think the author, Cixin Liu, had a unique take on that theme. I realized going in that the book was only the first book of a trilogy and I won't let that detract from my rating. I definitely will want to continue with this trilogy--and expect ( or hope ) that the story holds up to my rating of the first book!

"Imao sam prilična očekivanja od Problema tri tela. Drago mi je što nisu izneverena. Već neko vreme ne uspevam da probudim staru ljubav prema SF, imam osećaj da me je u poslednje vreme zaista oduševio samo Ted Chiang.

Prvi deo ove trilogije je uzbudljiv sam po sebi, a uz to lepo postavlja scenu za nastavak priče. Priča počinje za vreme kineske ""kulturne"" revolucije, a nakon toga skače kroz vreme unapred i unazad, većinu vremena dešavajući se na teritoriji Kine. To je i jedna od zanimljivih stvari - centar velikog globalnog problema izmešten je iz zapadnih centara, pa je tako i upoznavanje kineskog načina života interesantan deo putovanja. Užasi kulturne revolucije su opšte poznati, ali zanimljivo je pratiti popuštanje totalitarnog sistema kroz 80-e, a pogotovo kasnije. Kina je možda ipak poslednjih 20 godina drugačija nego što su pokušavali da nam je predstave.

Sam problem ""problem određivanja trajektorija za svako od tri tela koje međusobno interaguju samo gravitacionom interakcijom"". I to je jedna jačih strana romana - tera te da razmišljaš, da se udubiš u komplikovane naučne teorije. Ako uzmeš da pročitaš usput nešto na tu temu, roman je bolji, mada je mene kasnije mrzelo da se udubljujem u teoriju struna ili u to kako bi izgledao proton koji bi postojao u sedam dimenzija. Koja su uopšte četvrta, peta, šesta i sedma dimenzija? Kako god, da bi čovek voleo ovaj roman, mora da ima sklonosti ka fizici, nije ovo samo priča o prvom kontaktu i njegovim mogućim razrešenjima.

Ja se radujem što ću čitati još dve knjige u ovoj seriji. Možda čak i ode u pravcu velike svemirske fantastike Asimova, ko zna.

"I wanted to love this. The idea was unique and intriguing. I also liked the idea of reading a big first contact novel presenting a different cultural perspective.

Alas I got bored. I began dreading going back to the book. We all know life is too short to read the wrong books. This novel was as alien to me as the dehydrated beings of the Three Body system.

The Three-Body Problem was:

- Slow-moving, often excruciatingly so
- Too culturally different for me to relate to (or at times understand) the interpersonal dynamics
- Too repetitive

I'm marking this for a revisit, but for now I'm abandoning about 3/5 of the way through. If it becomes a movie, as some have suggested, I'll have all the background in my pocket. If it is a Hollywood production, they'll surely close that cultural abyss too.

The child asks the adult, ‘Are they heroes?’
The adult says no.

The adult again says no.

The child asks, ‘Then who are they?’
The adult says, ‘History.”


I picked up The Three Body Problem specially for a Literature Seminar I was going to attend, examining Chinese contemporary Science fiction, and wow I'm glad I did. Admittedly, this novel took me a while to finish, with its aura of obfuscation as well as heavy mechanical jargon, but now I'm just sitting in sheet awe of the genius behind its conception, and find myself having actual interest in physics?

I never thought I'd see this day.

Este es un libro se lee de un tirón pero que al acabar me deja una sensación de falta de profundidad. Cierto que consigue hacer inteligible un problema físico muy complejo y que crea una civilización creíble, pero a costa de una narración en la que los personajes son muy planos. La ambientación en la Tierra resulta aséptica, anodina. Podría cambiar los nombres de los personajes y situarlos en cualquier otra parte del mundo y no necesitaría hacer grandes cambios.

"It is hard to review this book—as an English native, I cannot help but feel it lacks a certain literariness. The poetic construction presents as rudimentary, even clumsy. But this, of course, is a perception rooted firmly in my Western upbringing. Different cultures favour different literary devices, and novels that read as masterful in their native language may appear awkward and unsophisticated when translated into a different tongue (through no fault of the translator). I keep all of this in mind when giving my rating, but also cannot deny the impact it has had on my personal enjoyment of the narrative—hence, 4-stars.

But, my god, . I picked up this book precisely for its science, for its ideas, and it did not disappoint. Cixin Liu's mind is a miracle. To give you a sense of the kind of work this is, I will quote not from the book itself, but from the author's postscript:





I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy!

"Woo, non-Western science fiction! I love the opportunity to get out of my ethnocentric mindspace. Liu Cixin offers up a science fiction set (mostly) in China during both the modern day and the Cultural Revolution. As such, he brings a lot of history to the story that Western readers are probably not familiar with. Nevertheless, he and translator Ken Liu do an admirable job spinning an engrossing story about humanity’s responsibilities, and what might happen if we don’t start taking them seriously.

A simple way to summarize might be to say that it’s about an alien invasion.

Or you could think of it as being about a philosophical video game.

Or maybe it’s better to call it a conspiracy thriller.

No matter how you slice it, you find that this is a novel with layers. Indeed, most reviews tend to note that it has three main plots—Ye Wenjie’s time at Red Coast Base, Wang Miao’s involvement in an international effort to discover why prominent scientists are committing suicide, and the story of the Trisolarans as told through the video game .

So the three plots in come to resemble the problem itself, which has been a thorn in the sides of mathematicians and physicists for a while. The interaction of any two plots is pretty simple to delineate. But trying to understand the interactions among all three becomes a complicated task.

The story excels when it is peeling back the mystery, layer by layer, only to reveal a new set of questions. My interest probably peaked at the moments when Ye was recounting her time at Red Coast Base, either to Wang or the interrogator, because we are aware of the significance of her actions in context. It’s possible to see the influence of the Cultural Revolution on Ye’s decisions: her faith in humanity has been destroyed by the way the Cultural Revolution tore apart her family. When she discovers it’s possible to correspond with an alien species, she sees this as an opportunity to change the Earth forever.

The virtual reality game, on the other hand, falls flat. This is a shame, because it’s a really intriguing idea. I just have so many questions, though. The way Liu portrays it makes it seem like Wang has a privileged perspective in the game—which would make sense if each player’s instance were isolated, but then how would Wang interact with these other human player characters who seem to recur from civilization to civilization? It’s difficult to understand, and trying to puzzle this out affected my enjoyment of the game as it climaxed and revealed the secrets of the Trisolarans.

I’m also not sure how the Trisolarans managed to advance so far if their civilization keeps getting reset. They make a big deal out of how the pace of scientific and technological development on Earth is accelerating, while theirs has always maintained a constant or decreasing rate. (Or is it that each previous civilization retains enough hazy memories of the last that it can bootstrap itself slightly faster, given a long enough Stable Period?)

I’m not too bothered by that, though, just because I can recognize a compelling SF idea when I see one. The Trisolarans are intriguing on two levels. Firstly, in them Liu has imagined some of the challenges alien life might face as it evolves in a completely different star system. I’ve never quite heard an idea like this before, and I love that. Secondly, their nefarious scheme to slow down or stop the pace of scientific discovery on Earth is also something new. Usually an “alien invasion” plot involves the aliens showing up with advanced technology and using big guns on bigger ships. Parts of this plot are stretching what is otherwise a fairly realistic science-fiction novel, but I can deal.

I suspect that your mileage with lies neither in a particular plot nor a particular character, though. Rather, it comes back to what I was saying above about the way these three plots interact somewhat unpredictably. There’s a lot of philosophy in here, particularly when it comes down to the way science interacts with society. But the major theme, as Liu relates it, is the way in which we will react when we discover we are no longer the only intelligent species in the universe. Will it bring us together or drive us apart? proposes one possibility but hints that, as the story unfolds in the sequels, that too might change.

In the end, I enjoyed the novel rather more than I thought I would given some of the reviews I read from friends. The ideas here, if not sweeping, are stimulating. This is one of the types of science fiction I truly enjoy, where the ideas drive the story in new and often unexpected directions.

But I also agree with many of my friends’ critiques. This is a dry novel, reminiscent of Kim Stanley Robinson’s approach but, I’d argue, drier still in its absence of emotional anchors—even Robinson’s characters have fits of pique. I suspect that’s intentional, though, because there is plenty of emotion during the prologue, and it leaks through at other points as well, such as when Ye confronts her mother or her father’s murderers.

The question at the back of my mind, of course, because I’m reading this as a Hugo nominee: is it Hugo-worthy?

Definitely of a Hugo, in the sense that I wouldn’t be upset to see this take the title. (And, you know what, Sad Puppies? In his afterword Liu mentions how he doesn’t use his fiction “as a disguised way to criticize the reality of the present,” so there you go. Although I don’t know if that’s just there to throw off the scent of the censors.)

In the end, though, I’m probably going to vote for . It’s a story that just has so much heart, in addition to being damn good, whereas is good and idea-heavy—against a similar book, like from a few years back, it would have the edge.

"This was conceptually compelling but narratively a little bit dragging. Still, this is probably one of the most unique and solid science fiction books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. I wasn't really drawn in by the scientific elements as much as I was by the philosophical implications of the story and social commentary interwoven throughout. In terms of characters, while interesting at first, I found them to be written a bit unimaginatively that it almost undermined the gravity of their actions. In fact, my unpopular opinion is that the Netflix adaptation's approach serves the story better in order to make them feel more grounded. However, I'd still recommend this to anyone who is looking for a distinctive approach to first contact.

"Una decepción casi total. Literatura barata, un bestseller en el mal sentido de la palabra.

La novela está escrita como un mal thriller tecnológico, una suerte de Código da Vinci de ciencia ficción en el que los protagonistas se desplazan de un escenario a otro para obtener la siguiente pieza de información (escenarios que quedan en su mayor parte a una manzana unos de otros, con la casa del protagonista en el centro). Los personajes son anodinos, planos, arquetípicos (como salidos de cualquier blockbuster de Hollywood) y se comportan de maneras freudianas/jungianas (ídem), fumando cuando están nerviosos, bebiendo cuando están preocupados, etc. En un momento dado, un personaje comete un asesinato a sangre fría simplemente porque le conviene y sin consecuencias profundas para la trama; de hecho hay bastante relleno intrascendente que pretende dar profundidad a los personajes, sin conseguirlo, y que aparece en bloques, alternando con el thriller. No obstante hay una subtrama que tiene cierto interés y salva el libro de tener una sola estrella.

Ah, todo esto es típico de la ciencia ficción hard, ¿verdad? Menos mal que luego vienen los grandes conceptos, las ideas alucinantes que te dejan pasmado... Pues me temo que tampoco es el caso. Pretende ser hard, pero no lo es. Esto es ciencia ficción a a secas, y bastante mala. Lo que caracteriza a la cifi hard es el uso e invención de conceptos o tecnologías que son novedosos pero que, hasta donde sabemos, son plausibles (es decir, si nuestra ciencia es válida entonces deberían ser factibles en el futuro). Cixin Liu no entiende bien la física, se limita a usar conceptos que parece haber leído de malos divulgadores científicos (esos que hacen tanto daño). Ejemplos:
* Una profesora de física dice que la relatividad general, con su modelo estático del universo, niega la naturaleza dinámica de la materia [¡! El personaje tiene razones para mentir en esa escena, en este caso podría ser a propósito... pero jamás se aclara, y hay muchos fallos más]
*

* Según los personajes, si se crea un agujero negro en un acelerador de partículas, absorbería el planeta mientras crece y crece [si se pudiera crear una agujero negro, que no se puede, se desintegraría por su propia radiación].
*

*

* Un protagonista es científico jefe de un laboratorio nanomolecular, y en varias ocasiones afirma que no tiene ni la más zorra idea sobre física de partículas, y se comporta como un ingeniero al uso frente a otros científicos (pero como un científico frente a personajes no científicos).
*


Hasta la mitad de la novela hay un ""misterio"" que es obvio desde el principio. Un segundo misterio, bastante interesante, es revelado desde el principio con una pista muy burda, lo que chafa la emoción. Luego aparecen otros enigmas curiosos, que se resuelven al final con un deus ex machina; no uno típico, sino explicado y diseñado, pero lamentablemente sin cifi hard (es más bien fantasía). Al menos esta idea es original, pero no es aceptable (soltamos un poco de pseudojerga científica, ""explicamos"" cómo hemos fabricado a Dios, y después contamos que Dios ha sido artífice de todos los misterios que quedan por resolver). Ni que decir tiene que el autor no se para ni un instante a reflexionar por qué este deus ex machina no sirve para resolver el resto de problemas con que se enfrentan los personajes de la novela, causantes de todas las tramas y tensiones.

En definitiva, un libro sólo recomendable para quienes no están acostumbrados a leer ciencia ficción, o para quienes disfruten de los thriller y quieran uno que sea mentalmente más demandante. Es deprimente que haya ganado el Hugo: o bien no se ha publicado nada mejor en 2015, o bien ya no puede uno fiarse del nivel lector de los votantes de este premio.

"Here’s a twenty-point Scrabble word for you: steganography.

I’d give you the dictionary definition but perhaps it’s better to start off with an example. Say your friend tells you she’s going to send you a secret message. What you receive isn’t a coded letter or a note written in invisible ink—it’s an email, and it only contains a single attachment: a photo of a landscape. Huh.

You examine it closely, trying to figure out what the message is. It’s just a picture of some trees on a grassy hill against a blue sky, painfully screensaver-esque. You magnify it to see if there are words carved into the bark of the trees, you mess around with image editing to see if there are any symbols of a slightly different green hidden in the grass. Nothing! You’re at a loss. It seems like a normal picture!

But to see the message, you need to go deeper still, down to the colour values of each pixel, and in those minute strands of numbers a pattern begins to form. With a little computer wizardry, you’re able to detect which of the pixels have been modified, what has been added or removed, and from there it’s not hard to figure out your friend’s message by stringing together the modified sequences into letters and words. This is, in essence, steganography.

My analogy is wearing on you, I can tell. The point of this exercise is that, in the above scenario, the message was in front of you all along, just hidden in a seemingly much blander and more boring format. Extraordinarily simple packages can contain massive amounts of data far more interesting than their disguise. And such is the case with The Three-Body Program.

On its face, the premise is simple. The story doesn’t pull many punches. Everything is kind of, well, bland, but that’s because there’s a far more fascinating story unfolding behind the one the synopsis tells you about—this is why NPR called it (accurately) “mind-unfolding.” This book can knock your socks off if you’re willing to look a bit further, peel back the banal interactions of characters and plot and recognise that the really good stuff lurking just behind.

So here’s the thing: as a book, as a story, The Three Body Problem fails on almost every level. The prose is dry. The characters are two-dimensional and all very similar. The dialogue reads like an essay. The plot moves glacially, if at all. Sometimes the scientific segments (which read like textbook excerpts and make up much of the book) are so densely written you wind up with sentences like these, which are far from being even remotely readable:

“The principles governing micro-scale integrated circuits were completely different from those of conventional circuits, as the base material wasn’t made of atoms, but matter from a single proton. The ‘p-n junctions’ of the circuits were formed by twisting the strong nuclear forces locally on the surface of the proton plane, and the conducting lines were made of mesons that could transmit the nuclear force.”

What? I mean... who is that ? Who enjoys that?

And yet! And yet! I loved every minute of it.

Liu Cixin takes an often painfully scientific view of the universe, everything backed by data and laws, but that doesn’t mean there’s no room for adventure. In fact, Liu’s view of the universe, cold though it may seem at first, reveals itself to be a veritable wonderland of sheer possibility. The fact that everything he describes could potentially be real only adds to the excitement. In denying wonder and thrill in the fabric of the story and the characters themselves, Liu shifts the reader’s mind so the excitement comes from the science, the numbers, the scale of it all. The vastness of space is the true setting here; the players, two distant yet all-too-close planets, and their inhabitants, shaped and moulded by their environments. The plot that unfolds doesn’t do so on the individual level—it’s galactic in scale, a march toward contact thousands of years in the making. It’s all so HUGE it’s almost easy to miss, but I really do believe that the story of Three Body lies not in the exploits of Ye Wenjie and Wang Miao and Da Shi and the ETO, but in the quiet, persistent orbit of the planets, in the speed of light, in the burning heat of an alien sun.

You’ve got to have patience with a story this cosmic, but it’s worth it. Trust me.

"Couldn't get into this a couple of years ago, but my best friend - an Italian guy who reads in at least four languages - swore by it, so I promised I'd try it again. And well…I got through it this time, but you owe me, Osvaldo.

General problems - way too long, and way too much talking; but fine, a lot of books are that way. I just had way more problems with the story itself, most of which (unfortunately) involve spoilers.

Basic concept:


Coincidences:


The aliens themselves:


The goofy science:



Considering the first few chapters on China's Red Guards and the Cultural Revolution, I have to take the whole book as a metaphor for that period, where insane belief in a nutball philosophy made people do some pretty screwy things.

A few themes here were reminiscent of other - and earlier/better - stories. The multiple suns and subsequent unpredictable periods of light and dark reminded me of Asimov's , while the initially weird aliens themselves (before they started sounded too human) made me think of (Asimov again). And of course, Earth defending itself from a planet-hungry alien invasion was very ""Independence Day"" - except the invasion itself doesn't even Earth until well into the second or possibly even third book of this trilogy…don't know, don't care and so will probably never find out.

Apparently, Netflix has just sunk big bucks into filming this, so let's see if they manage to turn it into something more palatable. I'm still on the fence over Apple TV+'s take on ""Foundation"" (Asimov yet ), but will certainly give it a look when it comes out next year. Probably.

I am fully a third of the way through this book, and I still have absolutely idea what it's about. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing; but it hasn't grabbed my interest enough to hold my attention when there are so many other and potentially better books whispering to me from my nightstand.

"This hallowed sci-fi classic has been on my shelf for some time, and with a giant Netflix adaptation on the way later this year, I figured I better get on board now so I can sneer at how inferior it is compared to the original book along with all the other angrily frothing nerds.

I also for some reason assumed this was sci-fi? With like lots of astrophysics and dense mathematics that would make sections of this impenetrable to only the most alpha of nerds? I'm not sure why I thought that but I was totally wrong; there are certainly some elements of astrophysics and stuff but it's mostly dumbed down conceptual walkthroughs that play out like a movie scientist explaining things for the tough military jock who says ""in ENGLISH, please!"" If for some reason you were like me and thought this was going to be hard reading, don't worry, it's basically a Blake Crouch beach thriller.

Anyhoo, parts of this were utterly fascinating and other parts were completely idiotic. It's very much an ideas-over-all-else kind of book, so if you're really into prose (real bad, albeit a translation), dialogue (same), or compelling characters (there's maybe half of one), you've got the wrong sci-fi series.

That being said, the ideas are very good ones. The back cover synopsis will tell you that the book is about how Earth sends out a signal that is answered by an alien civilization on the brink of destruction that plans to come and take over our planet. It's certainly very much about that, but it takes a while to get there. Instead we get a lot of table-setting flashbacks to China's Cultural Revolution to tell us why certain characters get involved in the throwing-signals-into-outer-space business. Those scenes are interspersed with present-day scenes where we learn all of the top physicists and scientists are going crazy and/or dying, but no one really knows why. Wang Miao, a nanotechnology professor, is asked to work with Shi Qiang, a noir detective stereotype, to figure out what's going on, and they have various wacky capers until everything is finally revealed in the last 50 pages or so.

At first I was a little impatient to get to the alien stuff, but it quickly became apparent that this book isn't really about all that. Instead I was thrilled by all of the parts where Wang Miao plays a video game. Stay with me. There's this game called Three Body that basically serves to introduce readers to the very real concept of , the question of how three bodies, mutually attracted by gravity, will move in the future if their current positions and velocities are known. It turns out this is important to understand why the aliens need to come to Earth, but really, I feel like the author was just fascinated by this problem and wrote an entire sci-fi trilogy around it so he could use the story as a fun way to introduce the concept to readers. Job well done in my eyes, because those parts ruled.

Everything else was kind of ho-hum police procedural stuff or background into vaguely defined groups that form to either worship or fear the incoming aliens. I'm sure all of this becomes more important in the other books, so maybe it's just necessary set-up for now.

I have no idea how they are going to turn this into a Netflix show (helmed by the Game of Thrones showrunners no less), but it will be interesting to see how successfully they are able to use the in-story video game to explain the Three-body problem. As for the books, I'm not rushing out to get the second one at this point, but I'm glad I at least got the gist of what's going on in this series (let me know in the comments if things drastically improve or decline).

"Woah. What just happened? I picked up this book and I was literally unable to think about anything else for 4 days.

I know that many readers have been raving about it already. It was published in English in 2014, after all, and it won the Hugo award, among many other awards. So, I’ve seen the reviewers clap so enthusiastically that their hands turned purple. I know I’m late to this party.

But, my God. What rare gem 💎 of a novel. One of those that I sincerely thank God for bringing into my life. Especially as a science fiction reader (and author! My “Genu: omnibus” has not been read much, but it falls into hard sci-fi) who has been a subscriber to “Analog” magazine for a few years and has always loved hard science fiction.

Chinese author Cixin Liu managed to write a book that can easily stand up there with the best of Arthur C Clarke (Childhood’s End, Rama, Fountains of Paradise) for the perfectly balanced mix of deep scientific detail, physical plausibility, shockingly creative ideas, very engaging plot (the pace never slows down, not even for one page), and profound existential questions.

The famous “sense of wonder”, so often referenced in science fiction reviews, is so intense and palpable in this story, that you would think the author is a genius child, in the sense that he’s been able to capture all the purity and excitement that many of us felt the very first time that we learned about the structure of our universe.

More than that, the questions that Cixin poses cut even deeper, into the fabric of our own existence as a species: is humanity something worth saving? Or is it not? And why?

Here’s a quote from Cixin Liu’s post-scriptum:

“”.

And … judging by the way he talks about the extremely small and the extremely big, he is spot on.

I’ve also always been deeply fascinated by extreme dimensions, especially the extremely small, since that day in physics class when my teacher said: “Well, of course, at a smaller scale than electrons, protons and neutrons, there is absolutely nothing. Total emptiness.”, which is such screaming bs. I’ve never had any problem imagining that an infinite “zoom in” into the atom (impossible with today’s technology) would give us a view on an endless number of universes… made of what, who knows. Not because I’m so smart… it’s because my teacher had a weak imagination.

Anyway, if you’re lucky enough to not have read the novel yet, I won’t be saying anything about its plot here, aside from the fact that it’s rooted in the real historic events of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, one of the most tragic and important events of the ’60s, and one that we Westerners don’t talk about much.

This book is the first in the “Remembrance of Earth's Past” trilogy—though the series as a whole is often referred to as The Three-Body Problem, or simply as Three-Body. I haven’t read book 2 and 3 yet, but I hear they are also magnificent.

There is a Chinese TV series already available on Amazon Prime (30 episodes!), it looks very well made. Netflix have produced their own version, which should come out in the next weeks. But please, if you haven’t yet, read the book. At least the first one. It’s a miracle.

"Hikaye Kültür Devrimi sırasında başlıyor. İdeolojik körlük çığrından çıkmış, Kızıl Muhafızlar adlı gençlik grupları polisin ve ordunun hiçbir müdahalesi olmadan şiddet eylemleri düzenler olmuş. Bilime karşı büyük tepki duymaktadırlar ve kendi ideolojileriyle bağdaşmadığına inandıkları teorileri reddetmekte, bu teorileri öğreten bilim insanlarını öldürmektedirler. Bu vesileyle çin kültür devrimi esnasında yaşananlar eleştiriliyor ancak bu mevzuları pek bilmediğimizden bir miktar sıkılıyoruz.

kitaptaki isimler çince olduğu için kimin hatun kimin erkek olduğunu hemen anlamak mümkün olmuyor. Takip kısmında gerçekten zorlandım ve vikipediadan karakter listesini sürekli yanımda tutmak zorunda kaldım ki buna rağmen yine de bazen büyükanneler ve torunlar birbirine girdi. Hatta hikaye ileri geri sarmalı şekilde devam ederken kaybolduğum ve doğru anlayıp anlamadığımdan emin olamadığım cok kısım oldu.

kitabin ortasına kadar uzaylı medeniyet ile ilgili konuların esamesi okunmadı. Hatta sanki bir intiharın ya da gizemin sırlarını çözmeye çalışıyormuşuz gibi ilerledi. Kurguda biraz sıkıntı hissettim. Bir şekilde kitabın başlarında akıcılığı yakalayamamış yazar. Merak uyandıracak öğeler kitabın son üçte birlik kısmında belirginlestiğinden, o kısma kadar sıkılıp kitabı terk etme riski var. Aksiyondan çok fizik yasalarının anlatımı var. Fazla sürpriz de yok. Giriş kısmı olmasa da kitap eksik kalmış olmaz. Konu ise , bilim dünyasının klasik tartışması; dunya dışı varlıklarla iletişim kurmak icin sinyal göndermek ne kadar akılcı bir hamle? Bizimle iletişime geçecek bir medeniyetin bizi yok edip, dünyayı kendi yurdu yapmayacağına nasıl güvenebiliriz?

uzaylı medeniyetin yaşadığı gezegene uyum sağlama yöntemleri gayet zekice kurgulanmış. yine uzaylı medeniyetin dünyadaki bilimsel gelişmeleri durdurmak için çaba göstermesi de mantıklıydı ama bu kurgular heyecanlı şekilde verilmiş sayılmaz.

girdikleri oyun evreni özellikle çok yaratıcı. anlatılan bilimsel konuların tutarlılıklarını ve doğruluklarını bilemiyorum ama takılmıyorum da buna, kurgu evreni içinde mantıksal kalması yeterli benim için. Mantıklı olup olmadığını da idrak edemedim gerçi :) yine de Öyle bir asimov dehası veya o tarzda bir bilim-kurgu eseri beklemeyin. Tüm ödülleri toplamış olması insanın beklentisini yükseltiyor ancak gösterildiği kadar dinamizm ve heyecan yakalayamadım ben. Yeni bir efsanemi derken birçok fikrin çok karmaşık harmanlandığı, karakter ve olay örgüsünün çoğu yerde birbirine girdiği bir akış var

Çok fazla teknik bilgi var. bu teknik bilginin altında kaldım çoğu zaman. Anlasam da anlamasam da hızlı okuyup devam ettim. Özellikle son otuz sayfadaki protonların boyut değiştirmesi mevzundan hiç ama hiç bir şey anlamadım. Sadece tasvirleri görsel olarak hayal etmeye çalıştım diyebilirim

Bunun dışında bilimin sınırlarına vardık mı, dünya dışı bir yaşamla nasıl ilişkiler kurmalıyız, bilimi gerçekte ne kadar önemsiyoruz, etiğimizin sınırları ne, insanın ve dünyanın geleceğinde neler olacak gibi sorular üstüne düşünmeye sevk ediyor.

Sonlara doğru nereye bağlanacağını merak ettirdiğinden dört yıldız verdim ama diğer kitapları okumayı tercih etmeyeceğim. Sanırım bir çok yenilikçi hikaye varken tavsiye edeceğim kitap bu olmaz.

"An intriguing, unique perspective on science, philosophy, extraterrestial intelligence, the fate of humanity, with a heavy dose of Chinese history and an alienated mindset that is quite different from Western way of thinking. Cixin Liu has deep thoughts on humanity’s reactions as a whole, its divisions, its evils, its madness, and how that will lead to its destruction. His interest in the personal level of humanity, however, is almost completely lacking.

I was rather disappointed in the beginning. Up until about 60% in, we had violent history, systemic madness, a seemingly all technical video game, some random mind influences, general cold-blooded killings and alienated characters. But at that point it took up: the threads started to converge, and creative scientific ideas materialized.

Scientifically brilliant, Cixin explores string theory and the implications of folding a particle of 11 dimensions into a two dimensional surface, which was fascinating. As dimensions were added, the size of the object got smaller and smaller in our three dimentional space. This is in the best tradition of hard sci-fi: taking the latest in scientific theory and exploring its implications.

Historically it is also fascinating. The book starts with the atrocities of the Cultural Revolution. Ye Xenji witnesses her father’s senseless murder, the subversion of truth, integrity and compassion. I have recently read about the Cultural Revolution in , where the author’s father is put to similar torture, so I knew this was a realistic depiction, not dystopian hyperbole - which made it all the more scary. Ye Xenji has good reason to lose faith in humanity - and this leads her to make her decision that alters humanity’s future. An interesting segway was the influence of on her, as her first exposure to a mindset of preserving nature, not destroying it.

The other elements of Chinese history are furnished via the Three Body video game. A common theme is alienation - expendability of humans in the wast and populous empire of China, using them as cogs in a machine.

The role of science is thoroughly examined. Basic research is what allows leaps in technology - from arrows and swords to guns and tanks. Without basic research, applied science can come up with better arrows and swords, but will never leap to the next stage. Cixin Liu draws parallels to the crippling of science under Mao to the planned sabotage of human development by the aliens. Their methods are also similar: drive the scientists insane with miring reality.

This is a very interesting work, hard science fiction from a different cultural background we are used to. While I was sorely lacking in connection to any of the characters, I acknowledge the brilliance and freshness of Cixin Liu’s ideas. I will be reading the rest of the series.

"Pretty cool, not what I expected, though.

'The Three-Body Problem' is a book I was curious about for many reasons, and almost all of them were met.
The story starts in 1960s China - to be honest, I didn't know much about the Cultural Revolution when I started the book but quickly caught up with a bit of help from Wikipedia. Seriously, sometimes my lack of information still amazes me. Not much sci-fi here, but this made it easy for me to get into the story. History and cultural topics are way more interesting to me. The story then follows Ye Wenjie, an astrophysicist, along with her path to present-day China. The other main character is Wang Miao, a nanomaterials researcher whose path is crossed by a virtual reality computer game.

Let's start with Ye Wenjie first. Having lived in Japan, I'm okay with the whole surname first, given name later, but I can imagine this might be a little difficult for other people. Maybe similar to my Russian literature problems and its tendency to have multiple, seemingly uncorrelated names for a character. Ye Wenjie is an easy-to-grasp character that I rooted for a lot at the beginning of the book. I wasn't okay with the turn her character did later, but I have to admit that it was believable somehow. I probably wouldn't take her actions, but it was easy to see why she acted in a certain way.
I like Wang Miao a lot more, although I don't know that much about his background. Since the story focused on Ye Wenjie's past, there wasn't much space for details of his past, but I still hope there'll be more information in the following books.

The 3body simulation game is almost like a third main character. It functions as a significant plot device that I don't want to give away. Honestly, I'm glad that I could stay away from spoilers. Simulative computer games have been a favorite since I'm a child, and I still like to play them sometimes. So, a big plus for the story - this part kept me interested throughout the whole book. Also, I love that the author was able to incorporate important historical and scientific characters into the story. I knew most of them and looked up the rest. A lovely way of talking about the history of science.
The science in the book differed from easy-to-understand to very complicated, and I can't say that I understand everything but what I understood was great.

The reason I gave this book five stars is the fact that it's a mixture of historical fiction and science fiction. I wanted to read a book set in China and written by a Chinese author for a while, and I'm glad that I picked this one. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.

"Liu Cixin has wrote a beautiful intellectual book that is often lyrical even in translation. It's just too bad that the pay off isn't as good as the set up. Half-way in I was convinced I was going to give the book at least 4 stars on the basis of its fierce intelligence and evocative writing. Then, it all just fell apart.

I've heard it said that culturally Chinese humor differs from typical Western humor in that in the West, we laugh at the punch line. But in Chinese delivery, you don't laugh until the joke teller explains the punch line to the audience, at which point everyone laughs together. To the Western audience though, explaining the joke is lame. Reading 'The Three-Body Problem', I felt a similar cultural gap acutely. After setting up his twist and story, Liu Cixin is not satisfied, but instead has to explain his story in great detail.

A similar cultural gap occurs for me with the meaning of the story, at least, what has been suggested so far. While the movie 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is likewise a beautiful, lyrical, and very intellectual story, ultimately its underlying theme of the false promise and ultimate dangers of freedom rings hollow to my ears, especially coming from China. 'The Three-Body Problem' for me had much of the same problems. I admire the set up, but the payoff just isn't that great. It's like someone setting up a really great philosophical thought problem, and then answering their question in a way that seems not only makes the whole question seem trite and contrived, but fails to really seriously consider the implications of the questions.

The characters strike me as stock Chinese characters that would probably even be more stereotypical and archetypal to me if I was Chinese than they already seem. I suppose though that in a book about ideas this is forgivable. In Chinese culture, it may even be part of the attraction.

While the science is mostly good and hard, it gets really implausible in certain areas in ways that just seem corny compared to the rigor elsewhere. I won't go into great detail because it would constitute spoilers, but I do have to ask exactly what is the strata on to which you could inscribe the circuits? What could those circuits possibly be made of? It's cool and all to play with dimensionality, but fundamentally regardless of the size the object in question it is undifferentiable at any point on its surface.

Still, for all of that, I enjoyed it enough and am curious enough about where the story is going to want to see it further.

"This is actually my husband's book. He received it as a gift from a friend who happens to be from China, with the explanation that 'it is very popular at home.' I have read a few of Liu Cixin's short stories (They show up on the Amazon free list occasionally.) so I knew it would be interesting.

Honestly, I can see why it is a bestseller in China. I can. But equally as honestly, this book didn't do it for me. I often find Chinese to English translation read very dryly and this is no exception. (I'm pretty sure this is a cultural characteristic of Chinese writing.) But the book is also very slow to get going.

The first half feels very random and though the end does tie it all together, I still spent 200 pages wondering what was going on. None of this is helped by the fact that it is very science heavy. Everything is explained well, but I didn't particularly enjoy sciences lessons.

Then, in the last half, when things do finally pick up I found myself irked about something else entirely. It's hard to address without a spoiler of some sort, but the POV shifts somewhere new and that POV feels far too human. We're told repeatedly that we don't know what they're like, but everything about them presents as human when it really shouldn't have.

All of the characters are also very thin. However, there are some interesting ones. Da Shi is one of the best anti-heroes I've come across in a while and I appreciated Ye Weing's flat affect.

I've heard that the 2nd and 3rd books are better than this one and if I happen across them I'd read them. But I'm not rushing out to buy them. This was just an OK read for me.

"THE THREE-BODY PROBLEM tells the story of several scientists and military personnel in China, weaving between a storyline in the past and present. The prose, translated to English by Ken Liu is emotive and informative, while also being highly readable - I had a hard time putting the book down.

An alien civilization in a three-star system - in fact the closest system to the Earth - faces constant death and rebirth on a planet called Trisolaris until they receive a transmission from the Earth. This gives the so-called Trisolarans hope that they might find a new home four light years away. The strategy for the invasion is revealed bit by bit with amazing imagery and an intriguing plot with plenty of twists and turns. My only gripe is that while the tale resolved the main conflicts - Ye's fate and the cause of Wang's visions - it left open many questions, including the vital one regarding humanity's survival. But then that's why there are two more books in the saga with the second being THE DARK FOREST and third being DEATH'S END.

The bottom line: THE THREE-BODY PROBLEM is old-school hard science fiction in the tradition of Asimov and Huxley, with futuristic technological theories combined with cultural and philosophical statements about what it means to be human.

"What a mess. It is an interesting mess, I will give it that but it was totally different from what I was expecting and not in a good way. The Hugo award (ok, that year was dumpster fire trashy, yeah, but still), Barack Obama recommending it (WTF. I confess I am going to hold this book against people who praised it highly), so I was expecting something, well, a lot less junk-food, and a lot more literary and/or scientific. And it is a very odd, very jerky story, with mostly micron thin humans, big reveal ideas and dramatic and/or gory scenes, many many unlikely things (more on that later) all round at all levels (psychology, evolution, astronomy up to even global economics).

What I liked: this a perspective into another culture, and there are some interesting ideas around. Its storytelling methods (character background and personality only introduced when they do something relevant, at the scene when it is relevant) are clearly of a different literature than what I am used to - and that was interesting of itself, actually (even if I prefer what I am used to, the modern western style novel narration techniques, I think it does me good to think a bit more about such things and read different styles). Maybe there is a novelty bias to it, but I thought all chapters to do with the recent history of China, the cultural revolution, chinese rural communities, anything to do with Ye Wenjie in general as the most interesting part of this book. She is the one I relate most to but even her characterization still has its WTFs
. Bits of Ye Wenjie's science work felt quite true and there is a scene with former red guards which had pathos on its own (but might be novelty bias, because it was surprising to me in ways it would not be to anybody chinese or more knowledgeable about modern chinese history).

There is an already famous provocative idea about this book, which I had been spoilered about, and which yes on itself is an interesting take to add this book to sf canon but it could have been a short story, or novella. The way that famous ideas is implemented was a lot different, a lot more unlikely all round than what I was expecting though.

But the rest, it all felt so so trashy and unrealistic. I did not expect that at all (see above, awards, Obama, all that). Trashy is, I realize, a really judgmental and not eloquent word, but once it was in my mind, it is the best way I can describe this. This book, as I interpreted it, is well intentioned propaganda, a moralizing sermon, on the value of fundamental physics research, experimental as basis for the theoretical, and the value of researching into fundamental physics but it is so contrived and heavy handed. But even worse it does IMO fail very hard at even getting what fundamental research is about even when it praises it. I spit, metaphorically, on what it does with the idea of
Also a lot of other tech/science related incongruities
.

Character wise, forget it, apart from Ye Wenjie (and not totally) these are not human beings they are just things to move the plot along. Worthy of remark, Shi, the policeman who smokes a lot everywhere and blows smoke intentionally into other character's faces, just because but he is the true talking salt of the earth somehow and he comes out with all the ideas and solutions and dunno, perspective on lots of situations where experts are stumped and he was invited. Come on. (I kept saying come on to myself a lot during this book.

There is a certain perspective I am assigning to cultural differences, the cultural revolution is clearly criticized, but there is a certain assumption about China's influence and place in the world which is again, unusual in other fiction I have read. (There is a passing reference to three main centers of particle physics experiments. What would be the third? I can think of two on their own class, but no idea which one would be put in the same class as them...)

Translation was by Ken Liu and it was OK but no more than that, for my own taste. Translations are complex things, I have certainly read worse, but I have read better: lively, competent translations (from the japanese for example, like the one for ). This translation was very concerned with small minutia (there were a lot of prissy footnotes. Like maser) but it did not exactly flow prose wise.

This was a spur of the moment with , who had lots of patience with my many irrelevant questions about China and the chinese original. She did like it better than I did! And while I am glad I did read it (I meant to ever since it won the Hugo. I keep meaning to try more non-english-written sff), I am not touching the sequels, or any more of his books, and that I am certain of.

"I vacillated between a 2 and 3 star rating, and finally decided it's a 3, rounded up from 2.5, mainly because the book is a bit of a page-turner, at least sometimes. The characters are relatively wooden, the references to past scientists are superficial (I mean, even Breaking Bad gave a nod to Heisenberg), and the preachy-teachy science and computer science lessons were a bit boring if one knows much real science. I won't be reading any more from this series. The wonder of real science is far more interesting than the not very convincing world that has been constructed here. By the way, there were more than a few implausible aspects of the ""science"" in the novel, but since this is sci-fi, I guess I shouldn't quibble about those.

"My PI recommended me this book and so I only really started reading it to get into his good graces (I am getting that future PhD position by any means necessary god damn it). I was never much into physics so I’m almost embarrassed to say I never even heard of the three-body problem before starting this series—and that’s one thing definitely did right: it somehow made me want to read up on theoretical physics on my own merit and even inspired me to choose a free-elective physics course as someone rusty on the course material (7 years of rust, in fact) instead of something that would have made my student-life a lot easier, like an additional ethics course (future me is most definitely cussing present me out for this decision but hey!—Life is all about rash ambitious choices made at 3 A.M. when my brain is bricked up on motivation from scrolling through multiple Instagram reels dubbed with Nicki Minaj yelling at me to study over a dramatic music score).



That is to say this book was pretty neat. I liked the physics and science in general. I liked the premise of Trisolaris and the evolution of their civilization. The characters were meh, although Da Shi was pretty fun, but that’s just how it is with most hard sci-fi (although I saw people debating its hardness but I’ll call it hard regardless—IDC it was hard for me okay?).

The author even explained why the characterization is done the way it is the story, so it was a deliberate storytelling choice. Now, it’s definitely not for everyone, including me (I love me some good characters and the people in this story sounded cardboard-y 9 times out of 10), which is why I didn’t give it the full 5 stars even though I had a good time.

This excerpt shows the author’s view on his characters which I thought was cool to include on his part:

— So yeah, I get it. The characters are there purely to amplify the contents of the story. Fine with me.

The entire bit about the shooter-farmer hypothesis didn’t fail in causing me an existential crisis until my PI assured me that no, the laws of physics apply everywhere in the universe and I’m not an intelligent two-dimensional creature living on the target of a shooter am I a scientist turkey (although I’m still not entirely convinced of either).

The book was cool. I’ll probably read the next installment in the series, but first I’m reading something that doesn’t turn my brain into mush for a bit of a breather.

"“The Three-Body Problem” is a science fiction novel, of the “hard” subgenre, that has received a great deal of attention. Much of that attention is due to a political tussle among science fiction fans, where some believe that various unworthy writings have been exalted by the establishment merely to make a political point about supposed under-representation by authors of certain types, including non-American authors. This book was nominated for the top awards in science fiction, and won the Hugo Award. Whether it “deserved” the Hugo I can’t say, having little basis for comparison in my own reading. But I can say the book is very good—with some non-trivial shortcomings.

I very much enjoyed reading the book (some spoilers below). It has ideas of startling originality, such as the sophons (I particularly was intrigued by the description of the results of various levels of dimensional unfolding). It pulls the reader along. It makes the reader want to read the sequels. Reading it was time very well spent. Yes, Cixin uses the “deus ex machina” a bit too much. And numerous plot elements, even the most intriguing, seem shoehorned in—saying, in essence, “look at my brilliant idea!” Even so, these problems don’t really detract from an open-minded reader’s enjoyment—and such problems are typical of the genre.

There seems to be much debate about whether certain dubious characteristics of the novel, including the flat characters, are not actually failings but rather part of the nature of Chinese writing. One angle on this debate that I have not seen anyone note is a comparison to the science fiction of Cordwainer Smith (real name Paul Linebarger; died 1966), who wrote a variety of classics, including “Scanners Live In Vain” and “The Ballad of Lost C’Mell.” He was an army officer, spy and professor, of Asiatic Studies, with extensive Chinese expertise, including as a confidant to Chiang Kai-Shek. It is said that his stories, all of which I’ve read, are based largely on Chinese narrative structures, and I think, without re-reading them, that they have certain parallels to this book, including flat characterization and a certain “feel” that is hard to describe but is somewhat unsettling for Western readers. On this basis, I suspect that some criticism of “The Three-Body Problem” is indeed misplaced, or rather a criticism (perhaps correct) of Chinese literature more generally.

The writing is mostly smooth. The translator (Ken Liu) is apparently quite good; any infelicities may or may not be the author’s, so I will not focus on them. But what is not quite good is the editing, which produces several gross and nonsensical plot and fact inconsistencies that could easily have been avoided, in both Chinese and English. For example, in more than one place, it is stated that the maximum speed of the Trisolaran fleet is one-tenth light speed; how that relates to total travel time is also gone over (in a clunky expository fashion). But in another place the Trisolarans state to each other that the maximum speed is one-one hundredth light speed. Random Trisolarans who know literally nothing about humanity or any other alien race, and just found out humans exist, state to humans that the Trisolarans have no “literature, no art, no pursuit of beauty and enjoyment; we cannot even speak of love.” But the Trisolarans could obviously have no idea what those are, if they lack them. The Trisolaran war strategy is to destroy human advancement by mechanically preventing further particle accelerator research—but at the same time, another key goal is separately stopping nanotechnology and therefore space elevators and therefore space defense, implying that merely stopping particle research is not in fact enough (and anyway it seems very doubtful that all further science depends on advancements in particle research). The Trisolarans explicitly consider humans “bugs,” yet at the same time are extremely fearful of their “terrifying ability to accelerate their progress,” relative to the Trisolarans’ own ability. The epidemic of scientists committing suicide is never given any real explanation. And so on. And on.

On a more positive note, something I have not seen remarked on elsewhere is that the book is largely an extended attack on today’s environmentalist movement, or rather on the (extremely prominent and important, and perhaps dominant) anti-human elements of that movement. The chief anti-human environmentalist philosopher today is arguably the odious Peter Singer (author of “Animal Liberation”), who thinks infanticide is great and humanity is a pest, among many other positions that mark him as evil. The billionaire chief human villain of the book relies on Singer’s book as his bible. The villain’s entire philosophy is anti-human (and pro-alien conquest). And he gets his comeuppance, which is to be cut into slices with no warning and no thought of giving him mercy, along with all his chief followers, and their movement is then violently and permanently crushed, to the evident approval of the author, and the very definite approval of this reader.

I find Cixin’s anti-anti-human message interesting because it’s so rare for an author to formally recognize the totalitarian and anti-human elements in much of today’s environmentalist movement. In fact, Cixin repeatedly and explicitly analogizes the anti-human movement in the book, which is a clear proxy for today’s environmentalists, to the different types of the worst elements of China’s Cultural Revolution (not that there were any good elements). Some in the book worship the aliens, some just want humans to disappear, and some suck up to the aliens hoping to gain advantage. (There are also clear, though probably unintentional, parallels to the famous 1941 Harper’s Magazine essay, “Who Goes Nazi?”) None of the environmentalists have anything to add to the correct position, which his “how can we kill all the aliens?” Frankly, I’m surprised the leftists who pushed Cixin’s book because it was non-Western literature did not find his obviously right-wing politics, in the context of the book, totally unpalatable. But it certainly makes the book different than the usual tripe pushed by social justice warriors.

Of course, as with nearly all science fiction, this is not great literature. Heresy, I know. “The Three-Body Problem” is basically memorable pulp. By that, I mean that great literature illuminates to the reader the human condition in some way, and evinces in its characterizations a keen understanding of human nature. It is therefore universal and timeless. Any other book is merely a more-or-less enjoyable diversion, or a textbook. Hard science fiction tends, by its nature, to pulp with a large dollop of textbook. It is written by geeks for those interested in how scientific facts and theories might play out under different circumstances. Its frame is science, not man. Nobody will remember this book in thirty years, much less a hundred. (Nor is there any reason to believe that the literature of each culture produces an equal amount, either absolutely or per capita, of great literature. In fact, a static, backward-and-inward looking society like China, philosophically focused on the Confucian desire to re-attain a mythical perfect past, has probably has produced vastly less great literature than European cultures, whether or not the social justice warriors want to believe that, which they don’t.) But hey, this book is still very much worth reading as a diversion. It just won’t change your life.

"El tema del posible contacto extraterrestre y las consecuencias que esto puede acarrear a la humanidad han sido explorados hasta el cansancio en muchos medios: cine, televisión, y por supuesto, en gran parte de la literatura, sobre todo en el género de la ciencia ficción; es de esperar que a estas alturas este tema pueda llegar a ser un tanto trillado y con poco margen de innovación; sin embargo, este libro me demostró lo equivocado que estaba. 

El libro sigue de cerca un viaje plagado de paranoia, miedo y angustia de un científico, Wang, cuya vida da un traspié inesperado de la noche a la mañana al verse en medio de una conspiración de proporciones enormes. 

Ambientado en China, en una época contemporánea a la nuestra, la comunidad científica está enfrentado una crisis imprevista: muchos científicos han decidido empezar a acabar con sus vidas alegando que todo lo que han creído y por lo que han dedicado sus vidas no tiene sentido en absoluto, la física es una mentira (básicamente)

No me gustaría dar más detalles de los necesarios, a una historia que a todas luces tiene la pinta de ser una más del montón ejecutando un tema que ha sido tratado una y mil veces; sin embargo, me gustaría afirmar con cierta seguridad que jamás han visto un enfoque como el que plantea el Problema de los Tres Cuerpos. 

A pesar de llevar un ritmo pausado, hilando y desvelando pistas y secretos muy poco a poco, es una historia que una vez logra atraparte no te soltará nunca. Eso sí, hay que aclarar de antelación que estamos frente a un libro que antepone el desarrollo de las ideas al de la construcción de sus personajes, y no quiere decir esto que este libro no ofrezca buenos personajes, en absoluto, Ye Wenjie, Wang y Shi Qiang hacen que este libro cargado de ideas y conceptos complejos no se sienta pesado y difícil de llevar. 

Considero que los personajes están al servicio de la historia de una forma muy bien lograda, sin sacrificar ninguno de los aspectos positivos de la misma o de desarrollo que se les da a estos

Eso sí, debo admitir que a pesar de disfrutar en gran medida de la historia no dejaba de sentir que estaba apenas viendo un ápice de todo lo que Cixin Liu podía hacer con las ideas planteadas en este libro, y es debido a eso que mi calificación no es más alta, pero es un libro que me ha sorprendido gratamente, me hizo redescubrir mi amor por la ciencia ficción y que me dejó pensando por muchísimos días luego de haberlo finalizado.

"In timp ce citeam cartea asta, care mi-a creat tot timpul impresii și stări contradictorii, am descoperit analiza unui booktuber cunoscut pe cărțile nominalizate la Women' Prize for Fiction de anul ăsta și cele cinci criterii pe care le folosește el: structură narativă/intrigă; personaje; decor/atmosferă; calitatea scriiturii; experiența personală de lectură. Și îmi place schema asta, cred că mă va ajuta să rămân cu o imagine mai clară a cărților pe care le citesc.

Așadar: intriga devine interesantă pentru mine abia în ultimul sfert al cărții, când aflăm ce e OTT - Organizația Terra-Trisolaris, cu facțiunile ei, Adventiștii, Izbăvitorii și Supraviețuitorii. Un cult, de fapt, fondat pe credința (elitelor) că oamenii au distrus planeta, sunt decăzuți moral și doar o civilizație extraterestră superioară tehnologic, deci și moral (?!) mai poate salva Terra. Doar una dintre facțiuni dorește să fie salvată și omenirea.
Cu siguranță pentru gameri și pentru pasionații de știință toată construcția a fost interesantă. Pentru mine - doar partea asta, dar toată nebunia cu pan-comunismul (egalitatea speciilor) și credința oarbă a intelectualilor în superioritatea unei exo-specii, cu toate dilemele etice care vin de aici au fost de ajuns să îi dau 4 la capitolul intrigă.

Restul a fost mai rău decât ma așteptam. Și nu mă așteptam la o mare valoare literară. Dar scriitura, descrierile și mai ales personajele de carton sunt de-a dreptul cringe. Nu există nicio dimensiune psihologică a personajelor, frazele sunt sărace, limbajul e super simplist dincolo de termenii tehnici. La un moment dat zice că ""timpul ar fi vindecat aceste răni, ca în cazul majorității femeilor"". Bărbații rămân nevindecați, să înțeleg.
Cam ăsta e nivelul de problematizare și stilul de expunere, anvergura intelectuală :), așa că dau un 2 pentru partea literară. [Unde sunt personajele din Dune, unde superbitatea stilistică a lui Solaris?].

Și pentru că tot ce ține de scriitură e la fel de important pentru mine ca povestea în sine (CUM contează chiar mai mult decât CE îmi spune scriitorul), experiența de lectură în ansamblu n-a fost prea reușită. Un 3 care, uite, îmi dă și nota finală pentru carte.

"It’s been a few days since I finished this book, and after digesting the novel, I think I’m ready to share some thoughts. First, I freely admit that part of the appeal of this book comes from the novelty of reading a translated Chinese novel - it did not disappoint.


Before I start talking about the book, I need to point out that the translator, Ken Liu, did beautifully. The prose is quite good, and Ken Liu did a marvelous job of retaining the differences in style and sentence construction between Chinese and American writing. I always appreciate metaphors, similes, analogies, etc. that are written by someone from another part of the world. We Americans have our preferred methods of explaining ideas, but reading this new voice from across the Pacific Ocean was quite refreshing.


The basic plot of is relatively simple and is set against the backdrop of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. (Talk about a moment in history that gets glossed over here in ‘Murica. I knew nothing about this period in Chinese history. It's totally fascinating.) The action centers around several scientists who gaze at both the very large and the very small. Through a series of discoveries, deaths and mysteries, the problem of the three-body system presents itself as a big dumb object plot ...well, kinda - but it works very well. It’s unfortunate that the dust-jacket blrubs all spoil the fact that aliens are involved - it’s a rather neat moment when it happens, and it would have been even niftier if I hadn’t known it was going to happen. Stupid publishers. (But not so stupid that we want you to stop publishing! Just clarifying…)

The science behind the titular three-body problem is also totally cool and mind-bendy (if you just run to Wikipedia and search for “three-body problem” it’ll kick back a basic overview of the concept), and one that I have never read about before. But Cixin Liu uses a sleek virtual reality video game to show slowly explain to the reader the erratic effects of a three-body solar system and how such a system would affect an orbiting planet, and the result is simple to understand and quite brilliant.

To be fair, the plot does not move very quickly, and the pacing occasionally feels uneven. Certainly most Western readers would balk at this, but I wonder if the novel's pacing is just part of the cultural differences between us and the Chinese. In addition, some reviewers have commented on the fact that Cixin Liu does a lot of telling rather than showing, and I agree, however, again I wonder how much of this is a difference between Western and Eastern expectations.

If you’re looking for an American comparison, I would compare the novel’s pace and scope and the author’s writing style to , , or a long-winded , all of whom write about huge physics ideas using engaging plots, but no one would ever claim that their plots are “super exciting.”

Overall, this is a fantastic novel, and a fantastic beginning to an already successful trilogy. deserves a place on the bookshelf of Science Fiction Awesome alongside other classics such as , , and . If this novel is indicative of the SciFi hiding in the East, then publishers, start hiring more translators and bringing these gems to the States. China’s first imported SciFi novel is a jewel indeed.


P.S.
Dear publisher,

The dust jacket blurb claims that contains the “scope of and the rousing action of .” So...you're saying it’s like...? Yeah, no - not even close. The trilogy might reach the scope of eventually, but it barely leaves Earth in the the first novel. And as far as the “rousing action” of ID4, not by a long shot. This is a very slowly paced novel that focuses not on rousing action scenes, but on the aftermaths of action scenes, and conversations, and explanations. Will Smith it is not. Every once in a while a bullet will fly, but not very often at all. Surely you can come up with better ways to call this novel a classic and hook people rather than comparing it to or ID4. Just sayin.’

"This is a hard review to write as I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand it is a powerful and extraordinary story with massive scope and vision. On the other hand it's incredibly slow and clunky beginning left me feeling a little drained (and confused) by the middle of the book.

The Three Body Problem tells the story of the Trisolarans, an alien race whose civilisation has evolved in a triple star system on a planet where the forces of nature are in constant flux. Faced with eventual extinction, they decide upon a course of conquest (watch out Earth) in order to survive. Meanwhile on Earth, the threat of this impending invasion causes factions to form in order to determine our response (despite the fact the actual invasion is hundreds of years away due to the distances involved).

Opening with a brutal scene set in during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the Three Body Problem launches into a plot that involves lots of violence and death, questions over the objectivity of science, and a secret Chinese SETI project involving a virtual reality game. And herein lies my problem with the first parts of this book. There was so much background to take it in and get my head around that I found myself bogged down at times. The story itself moves at a very slow pace, and whilst it all comes together in the end wonderfully there were times I contemplated not finishing (my advice, keep going, it's worth it). I also really struggled to connect with the main protagonists in these early parts. Ye Wenjie's moments were fascinating but too few and far between. And Wang Miao really didn't have an impact on me until significant plot points started to become clearer (global conspiracies, alien contact, and the role of the Three Body game). In saying this once I reached the halfway point of the book things started to pick up and become more exciting and immersive, as earlier plot points became clearer and the direction of the book more concise. The last part of the book, from the perspective of the Trisolarans, was exhilarating (note, basic knowledge of particle physics may aid in your enjoyment) and made the initial slog worth it.

The other saving grace for the Three Body Problem are the ideas and concepts that it deals with. I adored the notion of the Three Body game, and the discussions around alien contact and the SETI programs fascinating and complex. As someone who has long been fascinated by the prospect of first contact with an alien species I found how the Three Body Problem dealt with it to be both bold and original. I also enjoyed the snippets of political, cultural, and military history that were inserted (footnotes from Ken Liu, who translated this from its original Chinese, are provided) into the story.

Where the Three Body Problem is mainly let down is in it's weak characterisation in the first half of the story. Those early chapters are where a writer needs to hook in its readers, and I felt that the Three Body Problem failed to do this adequately for my taste. Some other reviewers have mentioned a couple of issues with the translation, and that may be a part of the problem with the first half of the book. As a Hugo Award winner (Best Novel 2015) though I decided to persevere with it, and ultimately I felt the book finished on a high both epic in scope and execution that left an intriguing set up for the next instalment.

The Three Body Problem was a fascinating and original story with some flaws. Ultimately though its incredible breadth and scope, when paired with its discussion of alien contact, make this book well worth the read.

"(People can see destruction, but most of them cannot see redemption.)

In my initial review I stated that this book reminded me of Marakami's Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of The World, due to dual world building. But that is a superficial observation, and the total content of that review was before I paid the local library the fines for overdue materials. 2016 was a good year for me to accrue library fines.

"বিজ্ঞানের নিবেদিতপ্রাণ ছাত্রী না হয়ে আসলে এটার রিভিউ করাটা একটু বেখাপ্পা ঠেকবে। তাই বেশ ভয়ে ভয়ে লিখছি। বিশেষ করে লেখকের সায়েন্স ফিকশনের প্রতি ভালোবাসা ও তা তাকে সাহিত্যের অন্যসব রূপের তুলনায় কেন বেশি আকৃষ্ট করেছে, তা উপন্যাসের শেষে এসে পড়বার পর নিজেকে এই কাজ করছি বলে, আরো অযোগ্য মনে হচ্ছে।

পড়তে গিয়ে বারবার নানা জিনিস বুঝতে গুগুলের শরনাপন্ন হয়েছি, এটা যেমন ঠিক, এটাও ঠিক যে সেটা করতে গিয়ে বিরক্ত হই নি। কারন, সিশিন লিউ যা লিখেছেন, তা এতোটাই পাঠককে মুগ্ধ করে রাখে যে আরো ভালোভাবে সবটা বুঝে এগোতে ইচ্ছা করে। এই সায়েন্স ফিকশনে বারবার তিনি চমকে দেন। ঘটনা একটা দিকে যাচ্ছে অনুমান করে পাঠক একটু এগোলেই পথ পাল্টে দেন। শুরু হয় ষাটের যুগে চীনে কালচারাল বিপ্লবের মধ্যে ইয়ে এনজির জীবনে ঘটে যাওয়া এক দুঃসহ ঘটনা দিয়ে। অ্যাস্ট্রোফিজিজিস্ট এনজি এরপর চাকরি নেয় রেড কোস্ট নামক এক কঠিন নিরাপত্তায় ঘেরা জায়গায় যেখানে বিশাল এক অ্যান্টেনা বসানো আছে। মূলতঃ শত্রুদের গতিবিধি জানবার জন্যই রেড কোস্টের উৎপত্তি। কিন্তু, যতোই সময় যায়, এনজি বুঝতে পারে যে রেড কোস্টের মূল কাজ হয়তো এটা নয়।

এখন বর্তমানে লেখক আমাদের ফিরিয়ে আনলে আমাদের দেখা হয় ওয়্যাং মিয়াও এর সাথে যে ন্যানোটেকনলজি নিয়ে কাজ করছে। তাকে সব কাজ থামিয়ে দিতে বলা হয় এবং চোখের সামনে সে অকারনে একটি কাউন্টডাউন দেখা শুরু করে। আর ওদিকে পুলিশ তার সাথে যোগাযোগ করে জানায় যে ইয়ে এনজির মেয়ে, ইয়াং ডং রহস্যময়ভাবে মারা গিয়েছে এবং সেটা তদন্তে তার সাহায্য দরকার। কারন, মৃত্যুর আগে ডং লিখে গেছে ফিজিক্স বলে কিছু নাই।
ওয়্যাং তদন্ত করতে গিয়ে খেলা শুরু করে থ্রি বডি নামক একটি কম্পিউটার গেম যা ভি স্যুট পরে খেলতে হয়। খেলতে গিয়ে অচেনা এক জগৎ এর সন্ধান পায় সে। এছাড়াও সে জানতে পারে যে এমন একজন স্রষ্টার কথা যার রক্ষার্থে আবার বুদ্ধের কাছে প্রার্থনা করে অনুসারীরা। এটুকু পর্যন্তই এতোটা অপ্রত্যাশিত কান্ড ঘটছিল যে এরপর আমি খুব বেশি জটে যাতে না জড়াই, সেভাবে পড়ে গেছি। কারন, এরপরই আসলে যেকোন কিছু ঘটবে, তা ধরে নিয়ে গোগ্রাসে গেলার সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়েছিলাম!

শেষে সিশিন লিউ কিন্তু সব প্রশ্নের উত্তর দিয়েই শেষ করেন এবং তা করতে গিয়ে কোন ফাঁকি দেন না। এনজির চরিত্রের বিস্তার ভালো লাগে। গেইমের মধ্যে হাইড্রেট-রিহাইড্রেট ও পেন্ডুলামের অংশটা ভালো লাগে। থ্রিসোলারিসের অধিবাসীদের কাছে পৃথিবী কি, তা জানতে পেরে সিশিন লিউয়ের চিন্তার ব্যাপ্তি মুগ্ধ করে। আর ভালো লাগে, ‘লোকাস্ট’ এর অংশটি দিয়ে যখন শি ওয়্যাংকে বোঝায় যে ‘পোকামাকড়’ শব্দটা আসলে অবজ্ঞার্থে ব্যবহার করা কতো অসাড়।

কেন লিউকে ধন্যবাদ, চমৎকার এই অনুবাদের জন্য। যদিও এটি আদতে পুর্নাঙ্গ উপন্যাস, তাও এটি একটি সিরিজের প্রথম বই জেনে শান্তি পেয়েছি। ট্রিলজির বাকি দুটো বইও এখন পড়ে ফেলতে হবে বুঝতে পারছি।

"این کتاب سه جرم کیهانی با نام اصلی
The Three-Body Problem
سرآغاز یک تریولوژی هست به نام
Remembrance of Earth's Past

دو تا کتاب دیگه‌اش به اسامی
The Dark Forest و Death's End
شناختن میشن.

این کتاب که نویسنده اش چینی هست عنوان بهترین کتاب علمی تخیلی چین را یدک میکشه و تقریبا همه جایزه های ادبی ژانری داخل خود چین را هم برده. یک فیلم چینی هم ادپت شد که از روش ساخته بشه که بعدا متوقف شد پروسه تولیدش!

سال ۲۰۱۵ هم نامزدی جایزه نبولا و دریافت جایزه هوگو را بعنوان بهترین داستان ع‌ت در کارنامه‌اش داره.

موضوع کتاب چی هست؟
کتاب در واقع در ژانر Invasion هست. در واقع داره آینده‌ای را به تصویر میکشه که زمین در انتظار یک تهاجم از طرف بیگانگان از نزدیکترین سیستم ستاره‌ای بخودش هست.
اما این پلات کلی داستان هست.
چیزی که داره اتفاق میافته دو روایت هست از زمان حال و گذشته.
وقایعی که در گذشته باعث ایجاد اولین تماس با نژاد بیگانه و جرقه مسئله تهاجم شده و روایت دوم در زمان حال میگذره و یک گیمیفیکیشن آن‌لاین هست که در آن شمارو با مختصات فرهنگی و نژادی و سیاره‌ای اون نژاد بیگانه اشنا میکنه و همچنین سرنخهایی از علت تهاجم در اختیارتون میگذاره.

بیشتر از این بخوام بگم اسپویل میشه.

و البته بگم داستان کتاب در اکثر جاها به همین سر راستی که گفتم نیست و در واقع شما همین الانم اسپویل شدید 🤭🤭🤭

اما نظر من در مورد کتاب.
نسخه اصلی کتاب را میپسندم.
و اگر شما آدمی هستی که به تاریخ نهضت‌های انقلابی در دنیا، نجوم، علوم ارتباطات، علوم کامپیوتر و شبکه‌های اطلاعاتی، معماری سیستم های محاسبات عددی و IT علاقه‌مند هستید خوندن و درک مطالب این کتاب را شدیدا توصیه میکنم.

اما نظرم در مورد نسخه فارسی کتاب چی هست.

در واقع تکلیفم باهاش مشخص نیست!

کتاب را میتونم بدو بخش روایت تاریخی و روایت علمی‌/تخیلی تقسیم کنم.

در مورد ترجمه بخش های تاریخی هیچ مشکلی ندارم و از خوندن برهه‌ای از تاریخ چین که از اتفاق مورد علاقه خودم هم هست لذت بردم.

اما در مورد بخش علمی یا علمی تخیلی، متاسفانه کتاب کاستی های زیادی در ترجمه و انتقال درست مفاهیم علمی در مورد اون زمینه هایی که گفتم داره.
بطور واضح مترجم به علوم مطرح شده تسلط کافی برای ترجمه صحیح مفاهیم را نداره و بنظر از مشورت افراد آگاهی در این زمینه هم بهره نبرده!

علاوه بر ترجمه، کتاب مشکلات ویراستاری هم کم نداره متاسفانه.

امیدوارم اگر قرار بر ترجمه ادامه مجموعه باشه بر رفع این نواقص اهتمام بیشتری گذاشته بشه و حتی کتاب اول هم از این حیث بازنگری بشه.

"“Siete insetti.” DAMNN 💀💀

Un’esperienza di lettura bizzarra, difficile da descrivere.

Partiamo con questa premessa: sono uscita dalle superiori con un’autostima obliterata, non riesco a percepire quanto effettivamente difficile sia un argomento (soprattutto scientifico) dovendomi basare solamente su quanto ho capito io. Riformulo. Io ho capito questo libro. Ma alle superiori in fisica non prendevo più di 5. Questo vuol dire che il libro è facile da comprendere? NON NE HO IDEA. È anche vero che fino alle medie non ho avuto assolutamente nessuna difficoltà nelle materie scientifiche, e che comunque sono uscita da uno scientifico con la media dell’8 e mezzo. PERÒ è anche vero che le materie umanistiche mi hanno salvato la media. Capite la confusione? Scusate la lunghezza della premessa, ma era importante per me farvi capire questo: non ho modo di comunicarvi il livello di difficoltà di questo libro.

Un’altra cosa che non ho modo di comunicarvi: la trama. Il fulcro (penso) della trilogia viene rivelato poco a poco, ne abbiamo una conferma solo alla fine di questo primo romanzo, e io non ho intenzione di rovinarvi la sorpresa. Quello che posso dirvi è che questo è un hard sci-fi, cioè una fantascienza dove la tecnologia, la fisica, l’astronomia, la matematica, hanno uno spazio fondamentale. È praticamente un libro intero di teorie e spiegazioni. E non riuscivo a staccarmi. È servita la mia preparazione da liceo scientifico o le spiegazioni sono chiare e comprensibili a tutti? Non ve lo so dire, davvero. Quello che vi posso dire è che, nonostante questo libro sembri più che altro una grande introduzione, io mi sono innamorata. Non tanto dei personaggi, che sono solamente veicoli per la storia, ma delle implicazioni, dell’idea, delle discussioni sull’umanità, sulla natura dell’essere umano. Sono curiosissima di vedere come continua questa storia perché le basi sono incredibili.

Quindi, dovreste leggerlo oppure passare oltre? Si.

"Un gran bell’esempio di hard science fiction, equilibrato senza rendersi astruso, come nella tradizione classica di Arthur Clarke. Bello anche dal punto di vista editoriale, asciutto rispetto ai suoi seguiti, ogni capitolo è necessario e ha una sua personalità. Le parti migliori per me sono tutte quelle ambientate nel videogioco dei Tre Corpi, per come creano una dimensione visionaria a metà tra fiaba e fantascienza e per la potenza delle loro tante immagini apocalittiche. È un buon romanzo nel suo insieme, ma per quelle parti l’ho davvero amato. Mi è piaciuta anche la dimensione storica, con la partenza durante la rivoluzione culturale cinese in una scena violenta ma non gratuita, specie per come si incastra a lungo termine nella costruzione del personaggio di Ye Wenje. Bello anche il clima da thriller tecnologico nel pezzo di storia successivo, con l’apparizione del misterioso conto alla rovescia. Ottima l’introduzione dei sofoni, visionaria almeno quanto le scene in Tre Corpi il gioco. E infine buono lo scioglimento che mette in luce dei nuovi collegamenti tra le varie vicende. Interessante la prospettiva sul primo contatto, la cui natura viene spiegata a fondo nel seguito (purtroppo molto inferiore a questo bellissimo primo capitolo).

"Tres cuerpos es una lectura entretenida para quienes disfrutamos la sci-fi. Me enganchó para seguir leyendo la saga. Pero ahí me planto. No le voy a poner el mote de “obra maestra” ni nada parecido.

Para comenzar, los personajes son llanos y estereotipados, bien sencillos para que no se complique la serie de tv o película que seguramente se haga. Los diálogos son burdos y en algunos casos rozan la tontería. Adicionalmente, cuesta entender ciertos conceptos científicos para alguien no formado en ciencias.

¿Qué es lo destacable? La trama y el desarrollo de la novela. Pasamos desde la revolución cultural china y llegamos hasta una civilización extraterrestre que obviamente no tiene buenas intenciones hacia los humanos. Se desliza una interesante crítica a nuestra sociedad, la religión, la importancia de la ciencia, la destrucción de la naturaleza por parte del hombre y la manera en que vemos al otro, al diferente.

En suma, una interesante novela con un aire a Asimov. Pero sólo se queda en el aire.

Das Setting in China und die Charaktere haben mir gut gefallen. Doch das Buch eiert teils um zu viele Details herum und gerade beim Hörbuch (das großartig gelesen wurde) haben mir viele Dinge einfach zu lang gedauert. Es hat mich nur mit Mühe geschafft, bei der Stange zu halten, obwohl ich eigentlich alles, was hier auf wissenschaftlicher Ebene geschieht, bestens verstanden habe, ich mag mir gar nicht ausmalen, wie es jemandem geht, der mit all dem nichts anfangen kann.

"I loved the premise of this book. It jumps right in and kept me wondering what was going to happen. The first half of the book is shrouded in mystery about what is happening to the scientific community, ETO and Trisolaris. The second half of the book, at times, gets really really technical in astrophysics, which is well above my pay grade. Great new perspective on alien invasions.

What I didn’t like about this book, was never connecting with any of the main characters… except maybe Ye. Her background and reasoning for her choices was well explained. Wang on the other hand, I have no idea what he looks like, what his background is, desires, dreams, etc. I know he had a wife and kids, because it said it in a single paragraph, but then they are completely forgotten in the story. Shi is even worse. For me that makes it hard to root for the protagonists.

Damn, this book was fascinating.

I can totally see why someone wouldn’t like this book. It’s very much hard science fiction and does not skirt on scientific details and mathematical explanations, but for me I loved all of it and the and complex ideas of humanity, science, and morality crafted and built upon by Liu here were just mind-blowing. I am super excited to read The Dark Forest and Death’s End because wow, this was a book about ideas that was executed so damn well.

However, I will say I did feel like it was in some ways a set-up book for events to come, but I personally didn’t mind that and it will definitely make reading the next two books more impactful.

REVIEW IN ENGLISH

This novel is one of those books that were so popular that the publisher brought it to my country, so Colombian readers could enjoy this work by Chinese author Cixin Liu.

Winner of multiple awards such as the Hugo in 2015 and a big besteller in China, this novel is the first in a trilogy that was originally published in Chinese several years ago and its first volume came out in 2006.

Set in China during the Chinese Cultural Revolution in the 60's, the story has several plot lines until the 2000's. We meet different characters along the way like Wang Miao, Da Shi and others, but the story begins with Ye Wenjie and her father, Ye Zhetai.

This novel gave me mixed feelings. Also the characters did not interest me and I did not even feel genuine concern for them. Everything is quite confusing at the beginning but when you continue you see how everything falls into place.



At the beginning of the story, China is going through a very tense situation in which people are being judged according to their political affiliation and this means repression for many. That's how Ye Wenjie will have to face a big change in her life and the circumstances will lead hear to make big discoveries for humanity.

Social and scientific issues are so well done here.

The characters left me really cold. I'm not sure if it's intentional or because most of the oriental books I've read had this issue. Almost all the characters are scientists and very educated people. Ye Zhetai is a professor of physics, Ye Wenjie is atrophysicist and Wang Miao is a nanomaterials researcher. I did not connect with them as I would've liked.

At the end we start to connect everything together but the end is kind of abrupt, with a scientific explanation so dense in the last pages.





Esta novela es de esas publicaciones que se pusieron en boca de muchos por una buena temporada, tanto así que decidieron traerla a Colombia para que los lectores colombianos pudieran disfrutar de esta obra del autor chino Cixin Liu.

Ganadora de múltiples premios como el Hugo en 2015 y todo un besteller en China, esta novela es la que inicia una trilogía que se publicó originalmente en chino hace ya varios años y este primer tomo salió en 2006. otro ya conocido autor chino.

La historia se sitúa en China y trata de varias líneas temporales que inician en la Revolución Cultural china de los años 60 y de allí hasta los años 2000. Con el avance de la historia, va Aunque la historia tiene otros personales centrales como Wang Miao y la propia Ye Wenjie en diferentes momentos de su vida.

Esta novela me ha supuesto sentimientos encontrados. y los personajes no me despertaban mucho interés y tampoco llegué a sentir genuina preocupación por ellos. Todo es bastnate confuso al principio y llegando a la mitad, no sabes a donde va la historia pero luego todo va encajando. Creo que es difícil hablar de la novela sin contar muchas cosas de la trama, pero someramente puedo decir algunos puntos centrales.



En el inicio de la historia, China está pasando por una situación muy tensa en la que las personas están siendo juzgadas según su filiación política y esto significa represión para muchos y el desprecio por el sistema económico capitalista. Esto para Ye Wenjie supondrá un gran cambio en su vida

Creo que la novela toca los asuntos sociales y científicos con un gran acierto y como como la humanidad está avanzando y al mismo tiempo retrocediendo en ciertos aspectos. incluso para personas que no somos del campo de las ciencias o tenemos conocimientos  muy básicos en la materia. Aunque no niego que hay fragmentos puede hacerse supremamente densos, pero hay que ir navegando por ellos. Por ende, la narrativa tiene que ver con esto, ya que tiene algunos flashbacks para explicar sucesos del pasado de la línea argumental de personajes como Ye Wenjie.

Los personajes son un aspecto que me ha dejado más bien fría. No estoy segura si es algo intencionado o es por su carácter oriental. Casi todos los personajes son científicos y personas muy cultas. Ye Zhetai es profesor de física, Ye Wenjie es atrofísica y Wang Miao es investigador de nanomateriales, por decir algunos. Pero por como al forma en la que están descritos y son narradas sus cirncunstancias no llegué a conectar tanto con ellos.

Lo más interesante es que mediante vamos acercándonos al final vamos conectando piezas y atando cabos y la novela llega a plantear una situación muy compleja para la humanidad:

La novela tiene una conclusión algo abrupta, Sin duda te deja con muchas ganas de seguir. En conclusión, creo que es un excelente inicio de trilogía y muy interesante, aunque para mi tuviera sus detallitos que me constaron avanzar con ella.

"Mit ""Die drei Sonnen"" ist Liu Cixin ein Überraschungserfolg geglückt. In vielerlei Hinsicht.

Zunächst hat er sicherlich nicht mehr damit gerechnet, dass sein Buch beinahe ein Jahrzehnt nach seiner Ersterscheinung überhaupt noch einmal verlegt wird. Dann gehe ich davon aus, dass er sich auch nicht hätte träumen lassen damit in Europa und anderen Gegenden der Welt zu punkten. Also ... überhaupt außerhalb Chinas, vermute ich. Und schließlich und endlich überraschte das Buch auch uns Europäer!

Wie viele Bücher chinesischer Autoren überhaupt übersetzt werden weiß ich nicht. Viele sind es bestimmt nicht, wage ich anzunehmen. Wie viele von diesen übersetzten Büchern dann auch tatsächlich (in signifikanter Zahl) gelesen werden ist naturgemäß noch schwerer zu erahnen. Dass aber auch von diesen nicht allzuviele Science-Fiction-Literatur sein dürften ist, behaupte ich, dafür um so sicherer.

Aber genug vom Rahmen - lasst uns einen Blick auf das Bild werfen. Äh ... Buch.

Das ""Drei-Körper-Problem"" ist ein real existierendes, von der Wissenschaft bis dato ungelöstes Phänomen. Es handelt sich dabei um den Versuch vorherzusagen, wie sich drei (Himmels-) Körper unter Berücksichtigung ihrer gegenseitigen Anziehung bewegen werden. Wer jetzt vor Entsetzen über diese unzulässige Vereinfachung tot umgefallen ist, der war vermutlich Astrophysiker; ich werde mich aber bei dieser Gruppe nicht entschuldigen, da der plötzliche Herzstillstand ein Weiterlesen nach der fraglichen Zeile sowieso unmöglich macht.

Wo war ich noch gleich? Ah ... genau. Jedenfalls ist dieses Problem (in seiner Gesamtheit) bis dato ungelöst. Und das ist der Ausgangspunkt für ""Die drei Sonnen"". Das Buch erzählt die Geschichte einer Intrige, in die helle Köpfe aus aller Herren Länder verstrickt sind. Wir lernen hauptsächlich die chinesische Perspektive kennen, die ihren Ausgang zum Zeitpunkt der Kulturrevolution nimmt.

Die brutalen Ereignisse dieser Zeit sind nämlich der Grund dafür, dass eine brillante Wissenschafterin in einer ganz speziellen, auf die Kommunikation im Weltraum ausgerichtete, Abhörstation landet. Während sie sich mühevoll durch den Alltag kämpft und mit den Folgen ihrer politischen Ächtung beinahe vollständig beschäftigt ist, geschieht das Unfassbare: Außerirdische reagieren auf Funksprüche von der Erde. Doch alles, was sie für die Menschheit haben, sind Probleme.

Und genau diese Probleme sind es dann auch, die den Verlauf des Buches bestimmen. Egal ob es darum geht die Außerirdischen Probleme zu lösen oder sie gar nicht als solche zu begreifen - unter den besten Wissenschaftern des Planeten finden sich viele, die sich damit beschäftigen wollen. Manche davon ernsthaft, andere beinahe religiös.

Sieht man einmal davon ab, dass der zeitliche Ausgangspunkt für die Ereignisse mit der chinesischen Kulturrevolution selbst für heutige Verhältnisse pikant gewählt ist, hätte der Plot sicherlich in den meisten Gegenden der Welt genauso gut funktioniert. Ich will damit nicht die Leistung des Autors schmälern, aber ein wenig die Erwartungen an das ""chinesische Element"" in diesem Buch dämpfen. Ja ... der Schauplatz ist die Volksrepublik. Aber die großen Einsichten in das politische und kulturelle System ergeben sich durch ""Die drei Sonnen"" auch nicht. Dafür allerdings erhalten wir die Gelegenheit die unglaubliche Fantasie des Autors kennen zu lernen.

Liu Cixin erschafft sich nämlich Außerirdische, die ich persönlich faszinierend finde. Obwohl sie während des ganzen Buches eine deutlich untergeordnete Rolle spielen, erfahren wir doch recht viel über ihre Kultur und Lebensart. Natürlich wissen wir so gut wie nichts über ihr Aussehen, sie kommen kaum je zu Wort und treten noch weniger häufig persönlich in Aktion. Trotzdem sind sie faszinierend. Besonders, weil das ""Drei Körper Problem"" für sie deutlich größere Priorität hat als für uns.

Was dieses Buch noch bereithält? Logische Spielereien. Denn jeder Aspekt ist penibel geplant, jede Überlegung der Figuren gut durchdacht und alles so plastisch beschrieben, dass man selbst bei den schwierigeren, abstrakteren Fantasieeskapaden kein Problem hat. Bewundernswert.

Es gibt Bücher, die einfach nicht allein stehen können. Geschichten, die so episch sind, dass ein einzelnes Buch allenfalls der Auftakt sein kann. und so ein Buch ist ""Die drei Sonnen"". Wer sich für die beschriebenen Spielereien erwärmen kann, vor logischen Überlegungen nicht zurückschreckt und bei der Erwähnung von Außerirdischen nicht gleich unter die Bettdecke verziehen möchte, der wird mit diesem Buch jedenfalls bestens bedient. Und wer sich doch verkriechen will, sollte das Buch trotzdem mitnehmen. Es zahlt sich aus.

"Full review: http://bennitheblog.com/bookbiters/th...

When the nation’s leading physicists commit suicide within a few months, the Chinese military and police forces recruit Wang Miao, a nanomaterials researcher, to assist them in infiltrating the Frontiers of Science.

When Wang discovers that a contact from Frontiers of Science has been playing an immersive video game titled “Three Body,” he decides to play for himself. What he discovers is nothing short of mind-blowing.

Here’s how much I love this book: If you only read one book in your lifetime, please let it be . “One book” may be too restrictive, however. According to translator Ken Liu (whose own novel, , will be released next year in April 2015), , the third book in the Three Body series, is “the best one.” That blows my mind—how does one best The Three-Body Problem? I guess I’ll find out in 2016—or earlier if I can will myself to read the Chinese version. (It may actually take longer; my Chinese reading skills are that rusty.)

is hard science fiction, but it didn’t become a phenomenon in China for lack of accessibility. In explaining the “farmer” hypothesis involving the fundamental nature of the laws of the universe, we learn (keep in mind all quotes are from an ARC; the final versions may differ):



One can only advance in the “Three Body” game if one first identifies the problem and then solves it. Each time Wang advanced in levels, the revelations brought chills. Speaking of chills, I quaked hardest during first contact (given the official book descriptions, this isn’t a spoiler).

In our real world, advances in solutions for the three-body problem were made in 2013. I have no science background, so I am unsure of whether the science in this book, originally published in Chinese in 2006, is still up-to-date. Regardless, The Three-Body Problem is everything hard science fiction should be, and its themes are important enough to transcend genres and labels.

Though science and its consequences are in the foreground, there’s also prose to appreciate:



And so I should also give props for the translation. Ken Liu noted in the Translator’s Postscript:



I have not read the Chinese version of this book, but Ken Liu did a great job of capturing the feel of reading the Chinese language.

It’s strange to end a review with thank-you notes, but this book is life-changing. I have to thank not only the author, Cixin Liu, for writing such an amazing book, but also Tor, Ken Liu, and Joel Martinsen for making it accessible for English-language readers. I don’t keep track of international literature, so I wouldn’t have even known this book existed if not for this translation.

Preorder today. You will be missing out if you don’t read it. If you’re one of my friends, be forewarned that I will hound you until you do.

I received a digital review copy of the book via Netgalley, courtesy of Tor.

"It was impossible to expect a moral awakening from humankind itself, just like it was impossible to expect humans to lift the earth by pulling up on their own hair. To achieve moral awakening required a force outside the human race.


If you somehow haven't read the synopsis on the back of the book, don't do it! It spoils a lot of the plot. Stick to the Goodreads synopsis, because that is all you need to know.

I've been intimidated by this book because it is adult sci-fi with some really hard science. I didn't even take physics in high school. Fortunately, there were footnotes that helped me to understand what was going on and point me in the right direction for further research. Probably the most important concepts you might want to know about are and link:

The whole time I read this book I was fascinated yet creeped out. There were so many interesting concepts to learn about and so much mystery I kept trying to figure out, yet at the same time I kept getting the feeling that I was a tiny dot in a vast universe or like someone floating in the ocean without knowing that there's a shark nearby. I felt like a small person in an unknown world and it was, but these feelings seem to be what Cixin Liu was trying to evoke in his readers. Cixin Liu's writing and Ken Liu's translation are simple, but there are small details like coding across the page and count downs actually being counted down that make you feel extra little.

This book deals with the concepts of being too limited to figure out the answers to the universe and how to deal if what you've been devoutly believing in your whole life was proven false. Many characters in this story are highly educated scientists, so you can imagine how these affect them. They become frustrated and overwhelmed and possibly end up questioning their own life. We are also asked to question our own existence. We can learn and discover and achieve, but what does that all matter when we are speckles on a planet that is a dot in a galaxy that isn't even visible in a map of an ever growing universe?



Usually I can only really get into stories with well developed characters, but this isn't the case with The Three-Body Problem. The only character I might have cared for was Ye Wenjie, a scientist who witnesses her father being killed during China's Cultural Revolution and who later is sent to work at a research facility in order to avoid punishment. Even then, I still needed to read between the lines to accept her actions and choices.

However, I don't actually think the characters were that important. It's the concepts and how these concepts affect people and civilization that make the story. Like I keep saying in this review, I felt like a tiny dot in a vast universe while reading, and this is how I imagined the characters, too. They just happened to exist in a bigger story, and I think this was intentional.

There is so much more I want to talk about in this review like the virtual reality game that is basically the Oasis of Ready Player One but for smart people, but I think that will lead to spoilers. If you've been curious about this book, I highly recommend it! It hard science fiction, but I think it is worth the extra work you may have to get everything you can out of the story.

"#5 - Top Ten Reads of 2015 at timothycward.com

Wow. That is the most fascinating picture of science in a story I’ve ever read. I feel ages more intelligent about astronomical physics and had a blast in the process.

The Three Body Problem might be the best book I’ve read this year, and will fight for top five of all time—and that after finishing The Goblin Emperor last week. Written by Chinese science fiction author and former power plant engineer, Cixin Liu, The Three Body Problem has been translated by Ken Liu and Tor Books after winning the Galaxy Award in China (our version of the Hugos). I won’t be surprised at all if it wins this year, and as much as I loved The Goblin Emperor…I don’t know. They are both amazing experiences of fiction, but I can’t help but feel The Three Body Problem has too many fascinating aspects going for it not to win.

First off, of all the things I enjoy learning about, I doubt I’d mention physics or astronomy in my top ten or twenty, and yet The Three Body Problem uses them in ways that make me want to earn a Ph. D. Granted, it is coaxed in the story of an alien invasion, which would more easily make my top ten or twenty list of cool ideas. The author’s expertise makes this story feel like it’s actually happened and I’m being told once the news has reached the public. The editing style keeps the info simplistic enough to balance that authenticity with the pacing of a thriller. The first third doesn’t progress as quickly as the latter two thirds, but I still really enjoyed it. I’d say this book is written for people that don’t realize they’re interested in the scientific advances of society, and wouldn’t pick up a magazine article on how the sun can amplify radio waves, but then they’d pick up this story and combine the meat of a scientific conference learnin’ with the thrill of fearing the end of the world.

The story you’re in for is about warring factions within humanity’s elite intellectuals between those who want to preserve our world and those who would rather sell it to what may be a more capable civilization on the other side of our galaxy. The Three Body Problem is a discussion on how to find peace within the search for scientific advancement. It spices up an already intense story of invasion with vignettes about the lives of Chinese revolutionary survivors, a professor sent to spy on the humans willing to betray their planet, a VR video game about survival in a planet with three suns, and much more.

The Three Body Problem explores the darkness of our society as seen in those who’ve experienced war, those who have it all, on the surface, and yet are completely alone, those who could cause the end of our world without blinking an eye, those who must live in hope of what could be because their lives will never be any better than what they are, and those who must kill everyone on a ship within ten seconds without damaging precious information stored on a computer inside.

I’m leaving this read with one of the best book hangover’s I’ve had in years. I don’t want to immerse into another world. I want to keep going and find out what’ll happen in this one. I also want to look into some light non-fiction about physics and astronomy because The Third Body Problem has shown me fascinating aspects of our reality I’ve never contemplated, but which make life that much more interesting and appreciated.

The Three Body Problem is the kind of book you’d take a trip to shake the hands of those who created it. I look forward to that chance at Sasquan this year.

"What an extraordinary read! There's something intimidating about science fiction. It's what you imagine those nerds that no one wanted to be friends with in high school to be into. You might think maths and physics and all those weird things. But then a book like The Three-Body Problem comes across and leaves me so grateful and excited that I'm willing to punch everyone who will question that .



is one of China's most popular books of that genre and has only recently been translated into English (by my absolute favourite that is!). It's hard to summarise the story without giving anything away, but we follow nanotech engineer Wang Miao, who is asked to infiltrate a secretive cabal of scientists after a spate of inexplicable suicides. His investigation leads him to a mysterious online game set in a virtual world ruled by the unpredictable interactions of its three suns and the key to the threat of extinction humanity is now facing.

I haven't read a lot of Chinese literature (yet!) and the sole way of plotting, character building and historical background felt unfamiliar to me. This made the novel more exciting, but also more challenging to get into. This is also definitely more than it is space opera and while it required my full attention and focus I still had to look some things up to understand the physics playing a role in this story.



This doesn't mean it wasn't fun! Cixin Liu has build a smart and clever story, which is imaginative and unpredictable. I felt like this book was driven by its ideas and the concepts behind it and what proved to be the biggest joy was the passion that could be felt. Before becoming a writer, Cixin Liu was a computer engineer in a power plant and it's obvious he knows very well what he's talking about. In a afterword he talks about his love for the genre as well:



Besides the science in this, it made me think about the concept of as well, the responsibility we have as a race and what it means to be part of an universe. Do we have an extraterrestrial counterpart? We didn't know yesterday, we don't know today, but contact between us and an Other might occur any day. And how that would impact our civilisation we have no way of predicting.

I really enjoyed the way this book made me think and address some of  my ignorance regarding China's Cultural Revolution. Although I don't really know much history, I'm grateful when a book teaches me some. There was violence, sadness, suspense, and aliens, mixed in with enough lightheartedness to make it all work.  Reading unique takes on how we will make contact with alien's and what will happen next was how I fell in love with science fiction. This story showed how intricately science and our humanity are intertwined. There were passages  that made me reflect on my relationships with others and how I understand existence. There were also passages that me laugh and frustrated which was just as important.





I like most readers usually skip acknowledgements and thanks, but the authors notes for readers of the American edition provided some great insight on what he wants readers to take from this book, and his love of science. In his own words:

"Woooowww. This book is definitely one of a kind.
I've read sci-fi books before but none have filled me with the same sense of dread and excitement as this one has.
The story jumps back and forth in time, it's set in the 1960s during the cultural revolution in China as well as in the present time. During the cultural revolution we follow Ye Wenjie, who's lost all trust in humanity as a concept because of the mistreatment she and her family members received during the revolution. Because she's an astrophysicist she gets placed at Red Coast Base which is supposedly collecting intelligence on US secret missions, but turns out to serve a completely different, much more startling purpose.

In the present, we follow the scientist Wang Miao, who is one day called upon to infiltrate a secretive cabal of scientist in the wake of a mysterious series of suicides. He gets drawn into an investigation that leads him to a virtual reality game with an unknown end goal, and he slowly realizes that the fate of all humanity is at stake.

This description of the book's plot is simultaneously way over-simplified and also quite confusing, I realize that. But I couldn't think of any other way to put it. This is probably one of those books it's best to go into knowing very little.

Here's one warning I will give you: This book is *extremely* science heavy. Probably 80% of that went waaaay over my head and I genuinely sometimes had to reread entire passages to vaguely understand what was being talked about. I thought that would bother me much more, but the surrounding story was compelling enough for me to keep going. It's definitely possible to follow the story and feel involved with it without fully grasping every detail of every scientific process being discussed, which definitely helped to keep up my enjoyment of the book.

The characters are an interesting point. I didn't particularly feel any special connections to any of them, because I never fully understood their thoughts and motivations. In a way this just added another layer of mystery and I ended up not really minding too much. For the most part, this disconnect didn't matter too much anyway, because they don't really play a huge part in the story. The scope of this book goes way beyond a single person's experience, which is evident in the fact that the characters are really just a means to tell the overarching story.

This book definitely takes some time to get into and some real committment since - unless you're a science buff already - you'll be spending a lot of time reading about stuff you understand very little of. Overall, for me the book was definitely worth it and I really want to find out how the story continues.

"U filmovima i knjigama iz oblasti naučne fantastike, vanzemaljci su uglavnom prikazani kao nepoznata pretnja pred čiji dolazak oštrimo sablje i osmišljavamo novo oružje kako bismo im se suprotstavili na pravi način. Međutim, šta bi se desilo u slučaju da neka grupa ljudi odluči da ih kontaktira u cilju sklapanja saveza i pročišćenja planete od ljudskih ""štetočina""?

Ova nesvakidašnja ideja rodiće se u doba Kulturne revolucije, mračnom periodu kineske istorije koji bi Kinezi vrlo rado izbrisali da za tako nešto postoji mogućnost. Jednoj devojčici će u tom periodu grupa studenata javno poniziti oca, zatim ga i ubiti na brutalan način, samo zbog toga što je naučnik koji ne želi da se odrekne svojih principa i verovanja. Ogorčena transformacijom ljudi u čudovišta zarad političkih uverenja i odnosu nemarljivog čoveka prema prirodi, Je Venđije se odlučuje za veliku osvetu.

Sa druge strane, u zemlji vlada panika zbog velikog broja misterioznih samoubistava cenjenih naučnika. U nadi da će brzo rešiti misteriju, vojska šalje na zadatak jednog stručnjaka za nanotehnologiju da se približi društvu u kome su se ubijeni naučnici kretali kako bi došao do odgovora. Taj put će ga odvesti do neverovatnih otkrića, a najviše će ga zaintrigirati video igra u kojoj igrači pokušavaju da reše problem tri tela, a u tome im pomažu poznati naučnici poput Ajnštajna i Njutna. Uznemiriće se kad shvati da je zanimljiva video igra dosta povezana sa stvarnim svetom kome kao i onom u igrici preti velika katastrofa.

Nisam pročitao mnogo knjiga iz ovog žanra da bih mogao da vršim neko poređenje, ali sve što imam da napišem su samo reči hvale. Da se radi o genijalnom serijalu, dovoljno govori činjenica da sam u ovom delu uživao i pored toga što na skoro svakoj strani ima dosta naučnih podataka iz sveta fizike koja mi je oduvek zadavala glavobolje. Samim tim što je ovu knjigu napisao fizičar, ona na taj način dobija na težini i ni u jednom trenutku je nisam doživeo kao čistu fikciju, već kao scenario koji nije isključen (u slučaju da vanzemaljci zaista postoje). Nažalost, ovu trilogiju ne mogu da preporučim svima, jer sigurno postoje oni kojima neće prijati dodatne lekcije iz fizike, ali što se mene lično tiče, mnogo se radujem ""Mračnoj šumi"" i nadam se da je autor nastavio u ovom pozitivnom pravcu do samog kraja.

"An SF novel told with ingenuity and panache. The Three-Body Problem reminds one of Asimov's The Gods Themselves, where an alien encounter is viewed from both sides. Here, the alien side is presented in the form of an online game called Three-Body, about a struggling civilization that must endure unpredictable changes in weather, and looking off-system for survival. The human side starts from the Cultural Revolution (in China), with the persecution of science and scientists, from which emerge persevering zealots who make the key choices that set the path for humanity's response. This might seem like the setup for an epic interstellar clash but in fact the novel aims for a more heady resolution.

Translated from the Chinese, this English version may have lost some of the lyricism that the story seemed to invoke. But that is always a slippery slope. Sometimes there are simply no fitting equivalents between two languages, much less two cultural views. Anyway, adjusting to the prose and style can pose a challenge for the first third of the book.

does better in fleshing out the monomaniacal, emotionally-compromised scientists, than with the military and police dramatis personae who seemed more like caricatures. He does get more free-wheeling and entertaining with the aliens in structuring civilization and defining motivations, and in the intricate build-up of the three-body system.

For me, the narrative picked up around midway to the keep-going-past-bedtime level. The ending chapters were quite special and worth the long delay to get this book on Audible. Liu has shown himself as a master story-teller, courageously innovative and quite ingenious with his fictional science. Highly recommended for SF fans, especially those who enjoy hard and classical SF.

"The Three-Body Problem is part first contact novel, part cyberpunk and part The Lives of Tao. As the story comes together, these parts form a very intelligent and intriguing novel. The scope of the story steadily grows as the climax of the novel approaches. [I don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave the plot discussion for elsewhere - like the comments, if you have questions]

The characters give a view of the very culturally different time and place of China, from its cultural revolution to 'present'-day. Some characters, such as Ye Wenjie, show how the cultural revolution affected the scientific community within China, and ultimately becomes the primary motivation for the decisions she makes in the novel. Other characters, mainly Wang Miao, work in the present day China and gets caught up in murders and machinations that are far above what he knew possible but his scientific mind does not allow him to ignore what is happening around him. Da Shi, a Chinese cop, would seem out of place in the story but he provides a lot of humor and the everyday-man insight into the story.

If there's anything to complain about its that the level of science may be a deterrence to some readers. Even before discussions of multidimensional objects and string theory, which I admit is a bit beyond my knowledge, there is lengthy exposition about solving differential equations and how computers work. I don't think it should negatively affect the story but, at times, the book reads more like a scientific journal (sometimes exactly like a scientific journal).

I can't speak much to the translation quality of the book, but there are frequent footnotes that explain the Chinese cultural references that, I assume, had no reasonable translation into english or that would take pages to explain something that was a part of life in China. And I thank Ken Liu for that, because it explains some of the inner workings of China that I didn't know.

I cannot wait until I can read the next part in the series, The Dark Forest, which is slated to be released in July.

"Si este libro me ha gustado a niveles estratosféricos, no quiero ni imaginar qué me depara el resto de la trilogía sabiendo que los dos próximos volúmenes son mejores.

«El problema de los tres cuerpos» es una absoluta genialidad, una novela tremendamente ambiciosa con un recorrido espectacular. Me ha resultado una novela absorbente de principio a fin, muy intrigante y que se va desarrollando de manera asombrosa, mezclando tramas claramente interconectadas que luego convergen en un final magistral. Un final cerrado, pero también un gran punto de partida para el resto de la trilogía.

Es una novela que toca muchos temas, sobre los cuales especula e intenta dar con gran acierto y originalidad respuesta. No sólo está todo el tema relacionado con la ciencia en sí; la crítica, sumamente velada, hacia la sociedad china y a la humanidad en su conjunto está ahí y es importante. Cixin Liu es un narrador muy aséptico y quizá eso choca con nuestra manera de enfrentarnos a este tipo de historias, pero a mí me ha encantado pues en ningún momento me ha impedido implicarme y reflexionar.

Me ha flipado cómo integra todos los conceptos técnicos y científicos dentro de la historia, hace que aunque el lector no tenga ni idea de ello sea capaz de seguir todo sin problema. Es cierto que hay partes muy densas, en las que el autor se explaya dándole vueltas a conceptos que pueden llegar a abrumarnos (uno de lo últimos capítulos es una locura fuertecita por lo compleja que resulta debido al nivel de abstracción que requiere), pero, aun así, el autor siempre consigue que no te pierdas, que la clave importante para entender la historia se entienda perfectamente.

En resumen, este libro me ha gustado muchísimo. Por su originalidad, su propuesta tan atrevida y tan bien desarrollada, por todo el trasfondo social, por lo que te hace reflexionar a la vez que te entretiene. Una verdadera joya de novela.

"1,5/5
To nie dla mnie. Przede wszystkim mam raczej za mały rozumek by wyciągnąć z tej książki wszystko co autor chciał przekazać. To oczywiście stawia mnie od początku na wątpliwej pozycji, co oczywiście nie jest winą autora. Niemniej przez to części nie zrozumiałam, inna część mnie zwyczajnie nudziła, a całość była momentami jakaś dziwna i sucha.
Przy lekturze trzymała mnie tajemnica do czego to wszystko zmierza. Budowanie fabuły wyszło autorowi całkiem nieźle jakoś do ponad połowy książki póki nie weszły do gry fragmenty dot. wirtualnej rzeczywistości (wątki z tym co się działo w grze były dziwne i nudnawe), a potem nie uderzył w cofanie się do przeszłości i obyczajowe wywody. Nie wiem czy jest coś gorszego w książce sci-fi.
Sam pomysł na fabułę fajny, koncepcja obcej cywilizacji też, ale wykonanie jakieś takie suche i nieprzekonujące (wątek bilionera z puszczy przebił wszystko - ani się śmiać, ani płakać - totalne kuriozum). Największym minusem tej książki jest brak jakiejkolwiek konkretnej akcji. Gdyby takowa była to znacznie lepiej odebrałabym całość i wszystkie niezrozumiałe czy dziwne fragmenty. Pierwsza połowa jeszcze się jakoś broniła, a potem wszystko poszło w opowiadanie zamiast pokazywania. Finalnie mam wrażenie, że autor przez całą książkę przedstawił nam jedynie tło (w zakończeniu bohaterowie są niemalże w tym samym miejscu co na początku książki) do tego co może wydarzy się w kolejnych tomach. Ja czegoś takiego nie lubię i to bardzo, a że nie przyciąga mnie do tej książki nic z pozostałych jej elementów (ani bohaterowie, którzy cały czas byli mi obojętni, ani język, ani klimat, ani ci nieszczęśni ""kosmici"", którzy wypadli jakoś tak mało poważnie przy całej reszcie) to żegnam się z panem Cixin na dobre. No, serial spróbuje obejrzeć - tam będzie się musiało coś dziać... prawda?

"Üç Cisim Problemi, insanın doğasından insanlığın geleceğine, bilimin konu edindiği en son teorilerden çeşitli felsefi tartışmalara pek çok konuyu masaya yatırırken, bazen politik kurgu, bazen polisiye ve bazen de katı bilimkurgu sularında yüzüyor. Bunların hepsini akıcılığından hiçbir şey kaybetmeden başarıyla harmanlıyor.

Hikayemiz Çin’de 1966-1976 arasında yaşanan Kültür Devrimi sırasında başlıyor. İdeolojik körlük çığrından çıkmış, Kızıl Muhafızlar adlı gençlik grupları polisin ve ordunun hiçbir müdahalesi olmadan şiddet eylemleri düzenler olmuştur. Bilime karşı büyük tepki duymaktadırlar ve kendi ideolojileriyle bağdaşmadığına inandıkları teorileri reddetmekte, bu teorileri öğreten bilim insanlarını öldürmektedirler.

Cixin Liu, bu noktada ileri sarar ve günümüz Çin’inde başka bir hikaye anlatır. Dünyada bazı bilim insanları şüpheli nedenlerle hayatını kaybetmektedir. Öte yandan Bilimin Sınırları adlı bir grup, bilimde artık sona gelindiğini savunmakta ve etki alanını sürekli geliştirmektedir. Diğer yandan özel bir oyun kostümüne ihtiyaç duyan Üç Cisim Problemi adlı bir bilgisayar oyunu, entelektüel çevrelerde ilgi görmektedir. Bu oyun, sıradışı mantığıyla, çok derin felsefi ve tarihi göndermeleriyle ve zor bir problem içermesiyle öne çıkmaktadır.

Üç Cisim Problemi için söyleyebileceğim tek olumsuz şey bazı teknik kısımların anlamayı zorlaştırabilmesi. Özellikle bilimle ilgili konulara yabancı olanlar bazı kısımları anlamakta zorlanabilirler, fakat benzer konulara ilgi duyuyorsanız Üç Cisim Problemi’ni çok seveceksiniz.

"Do you like hard sci-fi? Do you like first contact stories? Do you like historical lessons? Then The Three-Body Problem may be for you. Unfortunately, it was not for me.

The Three-Body Problem is a huge hit in China. The story starts in 1967 during the Cultural Revolution before settling in mid-2000s China. Our main characters are Ye, a young woman during the Revolution and Wang, a nanoscientist in the present day. I never connected much with either character. Ye's story would have been more prescient if we experienced events with her rather than in flashbacks. Wang has pretty much no personality.

Perhaps something in this book got lost in translation or I'm just not used to 's style of writing but this book was so dry most of the time. The characters are flat. The plot moves along a crawl. This novel is almost entirely background and set-up for the books to follow (which I won't be reading). There was no emotional core for me. I couldn't connect to what was happening or any of the characters (other than Da Shi who was funny and had more personality than every other character put together).

Also it took me 4 days to read this book and every day I ended up with a migraine. Coincidence? I think not.

Anyways... this book just wasn't for me. But if you're into hard sci-fi and a lot of technobabble and infodumps, this might be up your alley.

"I tried, I swear I tried and I wanted to love it - but I think I'm gonna have to put it back on the shelf. When I ordered this book, I ordered not one but three copies of it - on a hunch it would be great (I mean, Chinese AND Hugo winner, gotta admit it sounds promising) and would make a great present for a couple of my many friends more interested in genre fiction than I am. I'll still send it to them, because you never know, it might just be me...
Non-existant characters (the unique trait of the hero is that he takes pictures to relax after his science job), the most obvious, cringe-worthy exposition (Ye Wenjie, I am looking at you), a whole arsenal of atrocious and gratuitous clichés (from Einstein playing violin in front of the UN building to video-game versions of Gallileo arguing with Socrates), a writing often clunky and awkward in its metaphors (then again that could be the translation), I really can't see what got people's attention.
I suppose the scientific concepts discussed might have some depth, which I fail to grasp due to my lack of knowledge in that area, but the shallowness of the characters motivation, or the lack of insight in the functioning of institutions, it sometimes feel like a 'young adult' fiction written by someone with asperger.
Anyway it's not all that bad, there are a few scenes like that of the Qing computer which comes close to rising above the mere neckbeard/fan-service, and maybe I should push through and I'd finally get into it, but I was already thinking of giving up a 100 pages ago, so I think this will go and join the notorious 'L'Abyssin' among the books I have given up on!

"I hadn't heard about this book before one of my GR groups decided to read it, and I'm not disappointed that they did. This science fiction novel is one that would appeal to those who are into the more science end of the fiction, and I can think of a few people who would probably enjoy the shit out of it from that perspective.

Personally, while I'm not afraid of a little science (even if it's not my favorite thing), it's not enough to carry a novel for me. This is a novel that unfortunately has a lot of science (and good stuff! Based on real things!) and interesting history (using the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution), but I felt no connection to any of the characters and, let's be honest - there's no real plot. The elements that exist (like the whole video game aspect, first contact, etc) are very appealing and I did enjoy reading for those things. I just wish, however, that Cixin had either written better characters or removed the characters entirely.

This was just translated recently into English, so there's no comparison to be made with other editions. It is the first in a trilogy called , a play on Marcel Proust's . The second book of the trilogy exists in English translation but I can't seem to get a copy through the library yet, which makes me think it'll be a while before I return to this trilogy. But it wasn't awful enough to prevent me from wanting to know more. After all, I am pretty drawn to first contact sorts of stories.

"Kinų science-fiction, kaip ten bežiūrėsi, šis tas naujo mūsų (o ir apskritai vakarų pasaulio) padangėje. Na, gal jau ne tiek naujo, angliškasis vertimas pasirodė 2014 metais, o 2015 nuskynė vieną iš prestižiškiausių fantastinės literatūros prizų – Hugo premija. Vadinasi, atkreipti dėmesį verta. Atkreipiau. Nesiginčysiu, verta. Bet yra „bet“.
Pliusuose – be abejo, egzotika. Ir pati Kinija, ir vardai, kuriuose iš pradžių vos nepasimeti, bet paskui kažkaip apsipranti, ir mažiau tyrinėti Kinijos istorijos puslapiai. Mokslinės idėjos – ir pati trijų kūnų bėdutė, ir nanomedžiagos, ir protonų išvyniojimas į velniai žino ką (neapsimetinėsiu, kad viską supratau). Pati siužeto konstrukcija irgi kaip ir be priekaištų. Žodžiu, gerai ir rekomenduotina. Bet eikime prie „bet“.
Veikėjai. Realiai kažkoks gylys bent jau bandomas suteikti Je. Kiti – labiau veikėjai kaukės. Kalba – čia nežinia, ką kaltinti. Autorių? Vertėją į anglų? Vertėją iš anglų į vieną iš dviejų kalbų,kuriomis lygiagrečiai bandžiau paskaityt? Na, labai jau paprasta. Kas gal nebūtinai toks jau minusas, bet į akis krito. Logika... Ok, gal ne logika, bet kai kurios motyvacijos ir poelgiai vertė trypti kojomis ir šaukti „Netikiu!“
Bandykim apibendrinti. Kaip ten bebūtų – geras mokslinės fantastikos (ir būtent mokslinės, o ne tos, kur kosmoso fone šaudo-gaudo lazeriais-šmazeriais) pavyzdys. Skaitomas. Ir netgi skaitytinas. Bet aš ilgai ilgai svarsčiau – duoti gerokai skystą ketvertą iš penkių, ar vis tik apsiriboti tvirtu trejetu. Tegul bus tas ketvertas. Gal tolyn trilogija dar labiau pagerės.

Un hard SF captivant (cine-ar fi crezut?!), greu de lăsat din mână și fff interesant! 🙌

CUVINTE CHEIE: extratereștrii, noțiuni de fizică, Revoluția Culturală din China, savanți, joc video

• ideea generală a fost genială, sunt f curioasă cum va fi urmărită în celelalte 2 volume;
• personajele sunt credibile și ușor dubioase, dar e de înțeles din moment ce sunt oameni de știință 😂;
• cartea m-a prins înainte de intriga propriu-zisă, căci începe cu o scenă din mijlocul Revoluției Culturale (un eveniment istoric tare violent și totalitar 🤦🏻‍♀️);
• modul în care a fost descrisă și construită Trisolaris: populația, planeta în sine, jocul video, condițiile de trai etc;
• finalul a fost… interesant 😅;

DE CE NU AM DAT 5*?
• m-a mai pierdut pe ici, pe colo 🤷🏻‍♀️. E drept că noțiunile mele de fizică și interesul pentru ele sunt limitate, deci poate a fost și vina mea.

"A caveat - I rarely read sci-fi, so I might be not the target audience. I liked the ideas and the science bit. But i did not like how the story is told: all characters are plain, the plot sometimes picks up, but often dragging a bit. Some might find the introduction of the computer game as a big part of the plot fantastic. I found it artificial and was struggling with the desire to skip those parts.

The interesting bits for me where the Cultural revolution and the philosophic reasons why a character wanted invites the aliens to invade our planet: to correct the mankind as we are beyond repair and would not fix ourselves. Such a view from a Chinese author made me think about the shared and culture-specific values.

2.5 rounded to 2.

"Erm….. very sad to report that this was a miss for me. The science rocked but unfortunately the fiction did not. For sci-fi I don’t really care if the writing isn’t beautiful or I can’t get attached to the characters (otherwise this would be getting a 1-star tbh sorry) but I need things to be FUN and feel BELIEVABLE. Crazy things can happen but I need to feel like oh shit! Possibly this could maybe happen in the future one day! But by the end of the book I was violently rolling my eyes because shit was just happening. listen I’m no physicist….. but even the non-physics related events and character motivations were straight up ridiculous. With all that being said I could maybe see myself being influenced to read the next book. Maybe. Perhaps the engineers in book club will convince me.

"This is an interesting work, but it`s obviously ideologically filtered to pass through censorship.

The Cultural Revolution is first shown as a major disaster, but towards the end of the novel, a reconciliations is achieved between the former mass murderers from the Red Guards and the victims.

Meanwhile, the victims gradually become the betrayers of humanity.

Nevertheless, I liked the bleak tone and the alert rhythm. The main ideas, the shooter and the farmer hypothesis are interesting, but not outstanding. There is an obvious influence from Ender`s Game.

Bottom, cool atmosphere and space terror, but ignore the ideology.

Изцяло класическа творба, с много силно и модерно авторово представяне и страхотно въображение. Радвам се, че достигна и до нас.

Личните ми впечатления включват чувството, че явно в Китай си имат точно определен модел за разказването на една история. Трудно обяснимо ми е, но си личи един определен ритъм, който срещам единствено при някои китайски автори. Интересен е за българския пазар.
Иначе в началото не успях да се впечатля, началото на романа е доста класическо (ако пишеш за този исторически период на Китай, винаги пишеш точно и само по този начин, изглежда), но включването на играта е страхотен плюс и с развитието си нататък историята вълнува все повече. Има си чудесен, силен финал. Повече от разбираемо ми е защо любителите на научната фантастика биха се влюбили в тази книга от раз. Аз давам три само защото силно ми се искаше някои иначе страхотни идеи да ме развълнуват повече.

"Originally published in China in 2006, The Three-Body Problem is a sci-fi novel that was very popular in it’s native country, becoming a bestseller and winning the Chinese Science Fiction Galaxy Award. The book was finally translated and published in the West last year where it received great reviews and won the prestigious sci-fi award, The Hugo. I enjoyed the book, but feel it was somewhat overhyped and suffers from some of the weaknesses of first novels in trilogies.

The title, a rather obscure reference that takes on greater significance as the novel progresses, refers to orbital mechanics and the problem of determining the motion of three celestial bodies moving under no influence other than that of their mutual gravitation. The plot includes first contact, global conspiracies, and virtual reality. As the first novel in a trilogy, it has the surfeit of exposition that seems to be endemic to most trilogy starters and the pace is initially rather slow because of it. It also doesn’t help that the novel is presented as a mystery and the reader is as much in the dark as to what is happening as the book’s main character, Wang Miao, is. Strange and inexplicable things are happening around Wang throughout the novel and as he struggles to understand them, he’s surrounded by scientists and government officials who obviously know more than they are telling. It takes almost 3/4ths of book before Liu finally lets Wang (and the reader) in on the truth of what has been going on and I really think the book would have been better if this had been done sooner. The pace does pick up after the denouement and it takes on the trappings of a thriller in these last final sections. The aliens, who have been largely enigmas through most of the novel, are finally introduced in the last few chapters and are suitably alien and Liu has done a great job of world building in the creation of their home world.

One of the strengths of the book is the setting. It was refreshing to read a novel set in China and the glimpses it gives into Chinese society, culture, and recent history are fascinating. The novel opens during the Cultural Revolution during the 1960’s and all of the violence and excesses of that time of turmoil are described vividly and provide a strong motivation for the actions that one of the main characters takes in the novel. Set in motion by Mao Zedong, the Cultural Revolution was an attempt by Mao to reassert his power by weeding out “bourgeois” elements from the government and Chinese society. Chinese youth, some as young as Junior High age, formed revolutionary brigades and violently confronted those adults accused of being “counter-revolutionaries”:

“At the edge of the city, on the exercise grounds of Tsinghua University, a mass “struggle session” attended by thousands had been going on for nearly two hours. This was a public rally intended to humiliate and break down the enemies of the revolution through verbal and physical abuse until they confessed to their crimes before the crowd.

As the revolutionaries had splintered into numerous factions, opposing forces everywhere engaged in complex maneuvers and contests. Within the university, intense conflicts erupted between the Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution Working Group, the Workers’ Propaganda Team, and the Military Propaganda Team. And each faction divided into new rebel groups from time to time, each based on different backgrounds and agendas, leading to even more ruthless fighting.

But for this mass struggle session, the victims were the reactionary bourgeois academic authorities. These were the enemies of every faction, and they had no choice but to endure cruel attacks from every side.

Compared to other “Monsters and Demons,”* reactionary academic authorities were special: during the earliest struggle sessions, they had been both arrogant and stubborn. That was also the stage in which they had died in the largest numbers. Over a period of forty days, in Beijing alone, more than seventeen hundred victims of struggle sessions were beaten to death”.

Another fascinating glimpse into Chinese society, is importance of political status and how it surpasses most other considerations:

“Yang, as the highest-ranked technical officer, did not enjoy a high political status, and outside of technical matters he had little authority. He had to be careful with his subordinates, and had to speak politely even to the sentries, lest he be deemed to have an intellectual’s resistant attitude toward thought reform and collaboration with the masses”

Overall, I’d say that this is a good, albeit overhyped book, and that the glimpses into Chinese culture make the book well worth reading. After a bit of a slow start, the book ends on a strong note and sets things up for the sequels.

"Dos estrellas y media. Llegaba a este clásico instantáneo sin saber nada de él, y durante toda la novela he estado debatiéndome entre tolerarlo u odiarlo.
Por un lado: lo bueno: la historia mola mucho. Es, además, un conjunto de muchas historias, todas ellas épicas, que van engranando a medida que avanza el libro. Historias que van desde la Revolución Cultural china hasta el viaje interestelar. Además, cuando parece que ya están todas las cartas repartidas, el autor mete aún otra historia interesante (la captura del barco, me viene a la mente, que es épica por sí sola pero tan solo una coda en el discurrir general de la historia). En ese sentido, muy bien. Un detalle es que hay un juego de simulación al que mucha gente juega, y es en realidad
. En este sentido veo claramente la influencia de El juego de Ender.
Lo malo: el estilo de escritura, naïf, simplón, terriblemente insuficiente del autor. Me recuerda a algunas novelas malas de autores noveles. No sé si es la traducción o que el chino se presta mal a estas cosas, pero el estilo es trompicado todo el rato. Cero fluidez. Difícil disfrutarlo.
Ya más relacionado con el oficio del escritor, de manera no solo constante sino continua el autor nos cuenta específicamente todo lo que cree que debemos saber, poniéndolo en boca del primer personaje que pasa por allí. Incluso personajes que deben de estar hartos de hablar de la información que nos están proporcionado la repiten para que el lector se entere, aunque no tenga ningún sentido en el contexto de la historia que lo repita. Incluso en varias ocasiones el autor se da cuenta de lo que está haciendo y se cree que debe justificar lo absurdo de las situaciones:





Y así todo el rato, contando y contando y sin enseñar nada.
Los personajes son planos. Solo hay uno, el comisario, que podría decirse que tiene estilo propio. Los demás se expresa de la misma manera y si solo viéramos sus diálogos jamás sabríamos que son ellos, son solamente el vehículo del autor para hacer avanzar la historia.
Otra carencia como escritor que me ha golpeado varias veces: ¿Cómo transmito al lector que, por ejemplo, un grupo cree a pies juntillas al orador? ¿qué frases les hago decir para transmitir la fe ciega de ese grupo? ¿Redacto un discurso potente y lírico a la vez, y dejo que el lector sienta lo que está sintiendo el grupo? ¿Describo los sentimientos de algunos integrantes del grupo para que se aprecie lo intenso de sus reacciones? Nah, para qué me voy a preocupar de que el lector lo vea, ya se lo cuento yo y sigo palante:

En cuanto a la física, obviamente no se puede criticar que se invente cosas que no existen (y se inventa unas cuantas; como digo en la parte de las cosas buenas, suceden muchísimas cosas en la novela). En cuanto a las que sí existen, tiene bastantes fallos de bulto. Hablando de un sistema de radioastronomía, que son básicamente antenas,

Ni la temperatura del sistema ""se siente"", porque las antenas están en un lado y tú en otro que puede estar distante, ni tienen lente. La radioastronomía se hace con antenas, no con lentes. Incongruencias y fallos como este pueblan el libro con una densidad similar a la de los terrícolas en Shanghai.
Otro: Hablando de los Trisolarianos durante páginas y páginas, de repente se descuelga con un ""no sabemos qué aspecto tienen los ojos de los Trisolarianos"", con lo cual deja de ser el narrador genérico y se convierte en un terrícola. ¿Desde cuándo el narrador de TODA la novela era un habitante de la Tierra? Hay varios fallos de continuidad de este tipo.
En conjunto el diseño de la historia me ha gustado mucho pero la ejecución es muy pobre. O al menos me he pasado las 400 páginas diciendo ""qué lástima de escritura, con lo buenas que son las ideas"". No creo que retome con la siguiente parte, la vida es muy corta.

"A second reading has confirmed and clarified my original feelings. The hard-sf aspects strengths are quite impressive, but for me the (usual) hard-sf weaknesses are close to fatal.

Most of the author's technical speculation seem defensible (he was an engineer). One might quibble about whether the Centauri system is really very chaotic, but that would be being wise after the event (the book was written over a decade ago). The invention that seems most questionable—the unfolding of protons from higher dimensions into planet-sized sheets of AI-substrate material—was so outrageous that I mostly followed it in awe. (Mostly. I do wonder what wavelengths those sheets reflected and transmitted, and how it was possible to punch holes in and tear apart what were supposedly quantum objects.)

Are the aliens implausibly human? What we see of them is quite human but consists of avatars tailored for human consumption. The glimpses we get of alien physiology and life cycles seem quite unhuman. On the other hand, the author emphasises the parallels between the two species by using verbatim the same passage to describe the thoughts and feelings of a human and an alien observer when they receive a signal from the other species. If there's a serious purpose to this, perhaps it lies in one of the sequels.

For me, the glimpses of China undergoing the cultural revolution were some of the strongest passages, but perhaps contributed to the sense that the book tended to go off in too many directions.

Finally, what kept me distant from the story was the writing: The prose of Cixin Liu, as presented here, is clumsy in its handling of tone and emphasis; it relies on infodumps, and avoids dramatising moments of emotional intensity. And its treatment of characters can be indicated by an example. We follow Wang Miao as a viewpoint character and learn about his interest in photography and his fascination with the now-dead Yang Dong, and suddenly after 25 pages, we learn he has a wife and son. This impression of misplaced focus is heightened when in response to his wife's concern about his growing (and obvious) anxieties, he tells her it's nothing, and she apparently accepts this. Are we facing an undomesticated pulp-convention? Certainly, whatever his wife's reaction, Wang doesn't care about it and we're not expected to.

Much as with by Sergei Lukyanenko, the translator tells us that the literary tradition in the author's culture has led ""to different emphases and preferences in fiction compared to what American readers expect""—but infuriatingly does not explain what these differences are, or when he chose ""to adjust the narrative techniques to ones that American readers are more familiar with"" and when he preferred to leave them alone. So I'm wondering again if I'm bringing the wrong expectations to the book.

A glimpse of the sort of thing that might be happening appears in the attitudes of many of the characters to the idea that Earth might be taken over by aliens. There's a widespread and unquestioned belief that humans are a Bad Thing and probably deserve to be exterminated. We can find some rationale for this bitter cynicism in such events as the clear-cutting of forests and the fact that one major character had watched her father abused and killed by the Red Guards. But (together with some general callousness about loss of life in the book) the fact that such self-destructive attitudes could be presented as self-evident makes me wonder—as a piece of completely uninformed speculation—if such grief and despair had become part of the the readers' or the author's* mental landscape.


* obscurely notes that ""due to the violence of the Cultural Revolution"", Cixin Liu ""was sent to live in his ancestral home in Luoshan County, Henan"" (presumably from his early childhood to early teens).

"Sobre todo este libro me ha parecido de una originalidad impresionante, había leído ya en algunas reseñas que no se trataba de un libro de ciencia ficción tradicional y no, no lo es, mientras que se podría considerar como un libro de los llamados de “primer contacto”, la manera en que se desarrolla la trama hace que, a pesar de que todo gira alrededor de esto, al mismo tiempo no parece ser la parte central de la trama.

Para los que nos gusta la ciencia ficción este libro en principio descoloca mucho, creo que esperaba ver naves espaciales, situaciones fuera de realidad y contexto, futuros atópicos o distópicos, situaciones científicas avanzadas, ya saben lo que comúnmente conocemos como ciencia ficción, pero lo cierto es que al menos toda la primera parte del libro resulta en una trama más bien de intriga.

Hay que reconocer dos cosas a este libro:

1. Que no se trata de un libro de ciencia ficción convencional, pero que tiene una situación de este género que sobrepasa lo esperado, con una calidad tremenda en conocimientos científicos, para los que amamos la ciencia ficción purista, este libro es alucinante.

2. Tiene una narrativa inteligente, tan dramática como intrigante, llena de giros de historia que sorprenden al punto de que, cuando termina el libro uno se encuentra con la boca abierta pensando “¡pero que carajos! ¿dónde está el segundo libro?”

Así pues, tenemos un libro de esos que son realmente fuera de lo común, que bien podría llenarle el ojo a los amantes del thriller como a los amantes de la ciencia ficción, con una narrativa inteligente, fresca, fuera de lo convencional y desde la primera página atrapante, que te va llevando de la mano, casi esperando que suceda una cosa para sorprenderte cuando no pasa lo esperado.

Me ha resultado muy interesante ver que a pesar de la enorme importancia de algunos de los personajes, estos no parecieran tener ninguna profundidad, para mí el autor le ha dado tanta importancia a la historia que todos sus actores pasan a un segundo plano sin llegar a ser personajes en absoluto planos, tampoco hay uno que se lleve la historia, simplemente todos cumplen con la función que tienen, lo importante es lo que pasa, lo que hacen para que la historia sea la protagonista siempre.

La última cuarta parte del libro es alucinante y además de eso muy interesante, el autor me ha fascinado con sus conocimientos y su capacidad de poner en negro sobre blanco teorías científicas que si bien no son del todo probadas o algunas ni siquiera sé si podrían llegar a realizarse, le ha dado un boom a mi cerebro, mis neuronas no daban para más y sin embargo todo ha sido explicado de tal manera en que he podido comprender la parte de la explicación del viaje de protones, de verdad hay que poner atención a cada palabra dicha en esta explicación, resulta tan interesante como importante para lo que se viene, supongo yo, en el segundo libro.

Sin duda uno de los mejores libros de este género que he leído.

Доходило до крайнощів: мовляв, хтось здатен тямити у фізиці, а хтось — читати книжечки, й ці два вміння ніяким чином не перетинаються. Так от скажіть мені, будь ласка, куди в такому разі подіти цю просто чудову трилогію китайського автора Лю Цисіня, а з ним і всю наукову фантастику загалом? Гуманітарії ж не годні осягнути викладені в книзі наукові факти та нюанси, а вченим нащо з��алася белетристика?)))

Однак досить про наболіле, нумо про книгу. Це — перша частина трилогії ""Пам’ять про минуле Землі"". Друга, наскільки мені відомо, вже перекладається українською, третьої, сподіваюся, теж довго чекати не доведеться, бо ж після прочитання першого тому ну дуже кортить дізнатися, що буде далі.

Голослівно зазначу, що наукова фантастика такого високого штибу мені нині рідко трапляється. Крім ""Квантового злодія"" та ""Фрактального принца"" Ханну Райяніємі й згадати начебто нічого (до речі, фінальну частину цієї трилогії теж іще не прочитала). Роман Лю Цисіня по-справжньому науковий, бо він відштовхується від конкретних фактів, як історичних (це, зокрема, Культурна революція в Китаї), так і фізичних, математичних, футурологічних тощо (наприклад, математична задача трьох тіл, вплив контакту з позаземною цивілізацією на людство, розповсюдження радіохвиль у космосі та багато інших). Численні примітки перекладача спрощують розуміння багатьох нюансів, однак аби розкласти отриману інформацію на полички, все одно доводилося гуглити деякі факти й поняття, просто фізично відчуваючи, як розширюється мій кругозір.

Сюжет також не підвів: тут і майже детективна історія першого контакту з інопланетянами, і реальні підстави для тотальної недовіри навіть найближчим людям, і проблема негативного впливу людини на природу, й віртуальний світ та моделювання у ньому реальностей. А ще — купа приводів, аби замислитися про речі, важливі, насамперед, для самого читача. Мене, наприклад, зачепила за живе потреба робити вибір між внутрішніми переконаннями та ""правильністю/неправильністю"", нав’язаною соціальними умовностями, адже загалом ми, зазвичай, чинимо всупереч власній волі, бо ""що люди скажуть?""... Але чи залишаємося ми тоді собою? От-от...

"This novel is appallingly difficult to review, in part because at different times in the reading this was a four-star and a one-star book in my opinion, in part because it is only the first novel in a trilogy, in part because there is little to say about it that couldn't be considered a spoiler, and in part because it's a novel translated from Chinese to English, which raises the question of whether some of my issues are with the original prose or the translation itself.

That said, I can make some general comments.

The scientific premises in this book are mind-bogglingly wonderful. Brilliantly imaginative. The influence of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke are readily apparent (Asimov comes up repeatedly), and it's a joy to see so-called ""hard SF"" once more able to surprise us.

That said, the storytelling is abysmally bad (if only the author had read some other SF greats Asimov and Clarke!), with two-dimensional characters, repeated information dumps, and extraterrestrials who are supposed to be utterly alien, and yet who act and think and squabble like humans do. Terribly disappointing and thoroughly unbelievable! Furthermore, the whole novel unfolds as one back story after another back story after another. There is next to nothing in the novel's present moment. This is one extended example of ""show don't tell"" FAIL.

What elevates this from a two-star rating to a three-star rating is something I may or may not actually be seeing, and that is a larger condemnation of a scorched-earth, ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"" mentality among some of the characters that hearkens back to the lessons that should have been learned in the immense tragedy of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. (One of the main characters is the daughter of a physicist who was executed during the Cultural Revolution for teaching the ""reactionary"" idea of general relativity.) Throughout this novel, there seems to be a repeated condemnation of allowing dogma (political or scientific) to become the kind of religion that demands that heretics must be destroyed. The larger commentary, then, on the irreparable losses that such dogmatic, even totalitarian thinking produces is well worth repeating.

"Congratulations Mr. Cixin Liu. You have just entered a very select society. What society is that you ask? The ""Authors I will kick in the nuts if I ever meet you"" society. Congratulations, your certificate is in the mail and you should receive it shortly.

Why? you may ask have I been singled out to become a member of a society so exclusive, there is currently only one other member, Well, we have elected you because when we the membership committee, which currently includes Badseedgirl and the creepy little voice that lives in her head, finished reading your book we momentarily thought Donald Trump might be right about the and anyone who makes this committee think that Donald Trump is right about is worthy of this award. In fact because of this achievement, this committee is proud to announce that you have you Mr. Cixin Liu have been awarded the prestigious ""Order of the Steel Toe""! That right not only will you be receiving a kick to the nuts, but we on the committee are happy to report that we will be wearing our steel toed boots at the time. Again congratulations you earned it!

But seriously, I don't know if it was because of the translation, or that it was written under the edicts of communist China, but scientist do not come off well in this book. This is a quote about the members of the ETO, the secret scientist led pro-alien group:



Really, I don't know what part of humanity this writer was talking about, but just ask a mother who has to decide to pay the electric bill or the water bill because they don't have money for both about the ""dark side of humanity.""

The thing is the sci-fi story is good, and I am curious to see what happens with the aliens, but I'm going to have to really think about how much I want to know before I commit to another book in this series.

"Безусловно зашеметяваща като мащаб и полет на мисълта твърда научна фантастика, която възражда надеждата, че дори на опоскания откъм подобен тип жанрова литература български книжен пазар са възможни чудеса. Амбициозно и като усилия, и като реализация издание, пропито �� многопластова дълбочина – мъчно за усвояване и осмисляне, но отблагодаряващо се за интелектуалната и емоционална инвестиция. Браво на ИК ""Колибри""!

Въпреки че твърде често се движи по границата на своеобразна поетична документалистика или натъпкана с фактология проза, сюжетът не спира да изненадва, умело водейки през серия обрати към приятното чувство на задоволителен, сплитащ нишките финал, който едва поставя основите на още по-епични и невъобразими продължения.

От кървавата лудост на Китайската културна революция, през виртуалните ре��лности на непредставими светове и мрачното безсилие на човечество със скован научно-технически прогрес. От суров историзъм към пиршеството на визуални и мисловни абстракции. От философски и духовни откровения към дръзко теоретизиране върху безподобен научен прагматизъм. От настръхващия мистицизъм на тайни общества към шпионски похвати и военни операции с немислим залог. От семейна драма, през обществени турбуленции, породени от идеологическа лудост и фанатизъм, към личното изкупление и търсене на място в света.

Няма да споделям нищо повече от сюжета, нито ще дам воля на критичните си мисли за финалните глави, които можеха елегантно да избегнат разграждането на пленителния ореол от злокобна неизвестност, обгърнал враговете на човечеството.

Наистина е крайно време Азия да заеме полагащото ѝ се място в жанровата литература с нетрадиционните си фантазии, почиващи както на древни културни традиции, така и на здравия фундамент в модерните си, витални и самостоятелни общества.

А аз мога да се нарека щастливец, че след като съм прочел „Трите тела“ (Цъсин) и „Сянката на вятъра“ (Сафон), тепърва ще се насладя на вече написаните им, преведени и налични продължения. Галеници на съдбата сме, че живеем в епохата на толкова качествена и достъпна литература 😊

"Update: Ik zie dat dit boek in oktober in het Nederlands gaat verschijnen. Ik ga het dan nog een kans geven. Ik lees graag scifi en fantasy in mijn eigen taal merk ik, dan pakt het me misschien beter, want het klinkt zó goed! Zeker met dat deel 2 en 3 ook meteen zijn aangekondigd, goed bezig Uitgeverij Prometheus!


Dat had ik anders gehoopt en verwacht.

Dit boek staat al lang op mijn TBR, ik wil meer scifi gaan lezen. Maar toch een beetje angstig om het op te pakken. Het staat zo goed aangeschreven, maar fantasy lees ik ook liever in het Nederlands, hoe zou het met scifi gaan?

Niet zozeer dat ik er de eerste tientallen pagina's een probleem mee had qua taal. Het was meer het verhaal en de schrijfstijl. Het pakte me niet. Ik vond het aanvoelen als een infodump, in plaats van dat een actiescène of een gebeurtenissen of een personage me het verhaal in trok. Ik verloor mijn concentratie, ik nam niet meer goed in me op wat ik las, maar voelde ook dat dat cruciaal ging zijn voor de rest van het boek. En toen besloot ik dat dit niet mijn ding is, dus.

Ik houd het voortaan dus lekker bij YA scifi of vertaalde scifi denk ik :)

"Para mi fue espectacular leer esta historia.
tífica muy buena.

¿Es pesado?, seguramente para aquellos que desconocen de términos científicos, pero la historia lo vale y amerita, además el tema de comunicación con seres de otros planetas vuela un poco la cabeza.

Debo confesar que yo no pude soltarlo, es decir no intercale con ningún otro libro, hay tantas ideas y detalles que de verdad considero difícil leer varios libros a la vez con este.

Me paso algo particular, cuando comienza la novela y nos muestran cosas de la revolución cultural en China, dentro de mi ignorancia yo creí que eso era inventado. Y no fue sino hasta el final del libro que me puse a investigar varios acontecimientos que nos hablan en la historia y sentí un balde de agua fría del horror. Esos acontecimientos fueron reales y peores de lo que nos cuentan. Fue un genocidio en China hasta con canibalismo. ¿Eso porqué no lo enseñan en la escuela? ¿Porque hasta hoy en día desconozco tantas cosas del pueblo Chino? y no saben cuánto me dolió saber que muchos años después, supervivientes del genocidio decían haber comido carne humana, violado, humillado, mutilado, torturado hasta con orgullo.

Lo que me quedo a deber un poquito fue que en escenas fuertes de la vida de los protagonistas, de esas donde casi echan las tripas de fuera, no sintiera que había suficiente fuerza ya saben de esa que piensas que te va a dar algo junto al personaje, seguía la trama y yo como ¿qué paso?. Por eso 4 estrellas. Me encanto el personaje del detective, todo un desgraciado crack.

Yo me había prometido no leer sagas o solo dejarlo en los primeros volúmenes pero ya quisiera empezar el segundo. Súper recomendado gente.

"""It's good"" should be the best words to describe ""the three-body problem"". I did really enjoy it despite some drawbacks, like
learning the names of the main characters, which are written in the first page - they are chinese, and i don't have much deal with China or chinese people, so of course those names seems strange and a bit confusing, so i read them once more, and then yet again... And then it goes like ""BAM"", and 90% of them are dead, and it's not even 1/10 of the book... Hell yeah, says me. ""Fuck you, haters"", says George Martin, ""Go create more memes about me killing off characters"". Besides that, and quite a slow start... Well, there is something more - I did not like basically all characters, maybe except Da Shi, 'cause, as I said numerous times, I've a knack for slippery bastards and anti-heroes and chaotic pirates like Sparrow, etc. etc.

That's all about things that were bad or not good at least. Now let's talk some positivity. The idea is brilliant. Plot is well done, gripping and everything happens just at that moment it should have happened, it's not too easy nor too hard to draw your own conclusions and theories, and last but not least - it's funny. Sure, it's not Harry Harrison or Charles Bukowski funny, but still. And it was nice to have started this book thinking that it would be a space opera, but it turned out to be a good old hard sci-fi.

Battery is running low, so I have to stop writing now, but be sure, that it is a good book and I will not be surprised to see it as a movie sometime.

"Generally, I don't prefer to read Sci-Fi as real science and its ever-changing paradigms have somewhat ruined their universe of possible ""fictional"" stories in my imagination. But I must admit that I enjoyed this book immensely.

The Three-Body Problem takes its title from an esoteric problem of orbital mechanics to do with predicting the motions of three objects whose gravitational fields intersect. The new technology and science behind it are well explained and researched, demonstrating the author's knowledge of particle physics, molecular biology, and computer science. The best bits in the story are the scenes that are hallucinatory, surreal, and sometimes terrifying.

Having a similar background, I empathized with the characters when they encountered unexplainable observations and pondered the questions - Can the fundamental nature of matter really be lawlessness? Can the world's stability and order be but a temporary dynamic equilibrium achieved in the corner of the universe, a short-lived eddy in a chaotic current?

Starting with a poignant story of the human cost associated with China's cultural revolution, the author takes us into a captivating journey that does feel like a thriller. The introduction of terms like Pan-Species Communism and Cosmic Sociology was fascinating. And the ending was incredibly visionary when the author, using superstring theory, explains the existence of tiny robots made from protons that have been unfolded into two dimensions.

"Sci-Fi book that pleases educated people and begs to be made into a movie. It mixes physics, astronomy, politics, history, detective, ecology, computers, AI, and so on with aliens. Half of the plot boils down to an advanced alien civilization who tried and eventually realized that it cannot solve the classical and unsolvable three-body problem (in this particular case - three suns). Their progress is continuously interrupted by the unpredictability and catastrophic effects of their three suns. When scientifically advanced enough, the aliens decide to leave behind their planet and colonize other worlds. The main underlying theme is that historical “progress” is identical with scientific “progress”, and this in turn is identical with fundamental and theoretical physics “progress” -- and the same “universal progress” manifests itself in the alien world as well as on Earth. This postulate of “universal progress” makes possible communications with “more advanced aliens” - as Earth eventually and inevitably moved into the information phase of its scientific progress in the last ~50 years. In the vast Universe and as bounded by the speed of light, the aliens no longer descend on us unexpectedly and with guns (as did for example in “The War of the Worlds”), but try to conquer us through digital communication and AIs hidden in subatomic particles. It seems to me that the book borrowed many of its themes from “Ender's Game”.

"In the afterword author says that “the most beautiful stories were written not by bards and poets but by science” (yes *science*, not even “nature” or God or anything that could make it metaphoric or religious or philosophical). And… yes. “Three Body Problem” reads as book written by someone so primitive and lacking basic understanding of culture not to mention human nature or storytelling, to say such a moronic thing. It's flat and boring and as imaginative as an academic textbook based on irrelevant theory disproved long time ago.

The premise is not that bad, but execution is, to be honest, shocking. It's so abhorrent I cannot even decide what is the worst aspect of it. Flat characters made emotionless by horrible past yet emotionally motivated though there is no way reader can believe this pieces of paper have any life in them at all? The structure that gives us the inciting event after the 50% mark? The style, this wonderful mix of primary school writing and Paulo Coelho truisms? Infodumping on a scale not even imagined before? (in a way this whole book is an infodump)

In what world do we live in where we prosecute authors for views literature but people saying such preposterous things literature get awards…?

It's bad. BAD. The only reason to read is to learn how the world without artists would look like. (spoiler: shitty).

"I'm big fan of sci-fi, this book was surprise for me. This is my first Chinese author. He is a new generation of sci-fi authors, I feeled this in his knowledge of computer games. As for me I'm big fan, especially in young ages, of computer games. The computer game is the important part of this plot. Also you will know a little from Chinese history, the cultural revolution. I was intrigued by the physics ;aws and the proximity of an alien civilization. Also i was intrigued by ""The Billiard Ball"" by Isaac Asimov and the Monte-Carlo algorithm, which is used to determine the irregular polygon area.

The intriguing plot of this book takes you to the China cultural revolution. As the scientist was killed, the story goes from his daughter. The secret project was established, and the big radio antenna was used to search for extraterrestrial life. When message from alien civilization was received, it was a warning, saying “don’t answer, or you will be destroyed”.

Then we are taken to the modern days. Humans received much information from aliens, and began to avoid any contacts. But the other part was admiring aliens. They created VR game, based on the information from humanoid-like civilization, which revealed the history of the development of an alien civilization and their plans for the colonization of the Earth.

"""To effectively contain a civilization's development and disarm it across such a long span of time, there is only one way: kill its science.""

An outstanding novel that brings together all the usual elements of science fiction--science, hopelessness, weird aliens, recruitment through online games, and human extinction--into a thoughtful, disturbing and wonderful story.
The narrative moves on several levels, jumping back and forth between a secret Chinese research facility called Red Coast during the worst of the Cultural Revolution. and near-future Beijing where nanotechnologist Wang Miao finds himself embroiled in a very weird video game called , where players advance by figuring out ways to prevent the world from being destroyed,and international conspiracy. I don't want to give away more than that. In fact, the quote above pretty much sums up much of the plot, in a way.
The politics is never heavy-handed and is woven deftly throughout as something to be lamented not cherished and there's a strong vein of timely anti-science activism throughout. I might recommend at least a cursory reading of an article on Chinese history, especially the Cultural Revolution, it might help you appreciate those books more.

"After a lot of much more convoluted prose lately, it's a pleasure to begin something rendered with such transparent precision and intrigue. Transparent is really the word here -- writing / translation are so straight-forwardly clear that they disappear entirely, and I'm never really aware of the writing at all. So when Cixin is rendering characterization, traditional action, and general exposition, this can feel a little underformed. But when, instead, he's presenting conceptual scientific material -- which actually is a huge part of the driving force of the story, which fascinates mostly through genuine scientific mysteries and thought-development around basic science -- this utter transparency becomes a benefit, as the most original theoretical material becomes the stuff of page turners. As such, despite my preference for the social aspects of the New Wave sci-fi this more traditionalist hard sci-fi is capable of breathing new life into that form.

La fantascienza è un genere che mi ha sempre appassionata, perché così lontana dalla mia quotidianità; e lo stesso posso dire per le culture più distanti dalla mia.

Questo è un romanzo che consiglio senza alcun dubbio a chiunque, anche ai non appassionati del genere, per via della sua maestosità che oltrepassa i confini del genere. Non vedo l'ora che arrivi sabato per poter leggere il secondo libro della trilogia, ordinato ancora prima di finire questo volume.

""Трите тела"", Лиу Цъсин, превод Стефан Русинов, изд. Колибри.
От мен книгата получава 3.5⭐️, в Goodreads 4⭐️. Сега чувам възмущението на доста четящи хора, НО въпреки оценката препоръчвам книгата и ми хареса.
В ревюто няма да говоря за сюжета, защото според мен тази книга е добре да се чете без никаква представа какво може да очаквате, така направих аз и не съжалявам.
Въпреки това за мен до края се открояваше дебата на Цъсин и неговите герои кое е по- важно голямото или малкото, индивида или обществото, наночастицата или планетата? ""Трите тела"" е като малък наръчник по история на Китай след ВСВ и основи на астрофизиката. В тази част моята sc-fi душа крещеше от кеф и водеше записки, проучваше имена на физици, четеше за теории и неразрешени проблеми на физиката. Лиу Цъсин има много стегнат стил на писане без излишни подробности, което за хора без много опит в научната фантастика е супер, за мен се оказа минус. Ако искате история, която ви кара да седите будни до 2ч и да не оставите книгата ден и нощ, това е отговара. Книгата се чете невероятно бързо, но до един момент това ми допадаше и към края вече препускахме през действието, което ми се струва неподходящото за типа научна фантастика, която аз харесвам и към обема наука заложен в сюжета. Прави ми впечатление, че в китайската литература героите са доста двуизмерни за разлика от западната и сякаш това се откроява като минус за мен. В ""Трите тела"" имаме хора изправени пред важни решения, тежки избори, а те ги взеха с лекота сякаш е УА роман, отделно едни нишки на западен екшън също ме разочароваха и това доведе до тази оценка.
Категорично не се подвеждайте от обема на книгата за мен е подходяща и за първа среща с жанра. С нетърпение очаквам екранизацията и да довърша трилогията, защото все още не мога да взема решението на въпроса на Лиу Цъсин- наночастицата или планетата?

Quarante ans plus tard, nous suivons Wang Miao, un scientifique spécialisé dans la recherche en nanotechnologie, qui, suite à une étrange vague de suicides dans la communauté scientifique, se retrouve sur la piste d’un mystérieux jeu vidéo.

Pitcher ce premier tome est loin d’être évident tant la majeure partie du roman sert à mettre en place l’univers et poser un contexte franchement dense. Mais c’est aussi ce que j’ai aimé dans ce roman : pendant la plus grosse partie de ma lecture, j’avançais totalement à l’aveugle, sans avoir la moindre idée de ce que l’auteur voulait me raconter. J’imagine que ça pourrait déranger pas mal de monde, mais pour moi ça a très bien fonctionné.
⠀
Ça faisait pas mal de temps qu’on m’incitait fortement à découvrir cette saga et que je résistais de toutes mes forces, d’une part parce que les tomes sont énormes (le deuxième et le troisième du moins), mais surtout parce que le côté hard SF m’intimidait énormément. Au final, je m’étais fait une montagne de pas grand chose puisque je n’ai pas trouvé de difficulté de compréhension majeure dans ce tome. Bon, il y a bien un des concepts abordés tout à la fin du livre qui m’a un peu fait mal au cerveau, mais pour le reste, j’ai trouvé l’auteur suffisamment pédagogue pour ne pas me sentir largué pendant ma lecture.
⠀
Au-delà de l’aspect scientifique, je dois admettre que j’ai eu un peu de mal à comprendre certains personnages, et surtout à comprendre leurs décisions qui ont pu avoir des conséquences dramatiques. C’était évidemment nécessaire pour le roman mais c’est vrai que j’ai du mal à imaginer que des personnes puissent être aussi naïves et/ou vindicatives, selon de qui on parle.
⠀
Quoi qu’il en soit, j’ai globalement passé un excellent moment avec ce roman. Je ne suis pas tout à fait certain de ce que l’auteur nous réserve dans les deux tomes suivants mais je suis vraiment motivé pour le découvrir. Je m’y attelle très prochainement…

"I wanted to like this book so much. I went into reading it with very high expectations, I had numerous conversations with people praising this book. I wanted to read it this year, but bumped it up my reading list – wanted to read it before Netflix screening. What can I say – it was a roller coaster.

Characters come across as cold, detached, I think it’s a cultural thing. I’m from a northern country myself, it doesn’t seem strange to me, but this book takes it to the next level and some people might find it unusual. Despite the coldness, characters are a bit two-dimentional, it’s quite common in older sci-fi works. Either way, I can see where they come from, why they act this way, there’s also character development.

The writing is stiff, wooden, I was determined to finish the book, so I did, but… The enthusiasm to watch the series waned. The game realm was the most interesting to me. This book feels like 60’s, 70’s, 80’s sci-fi classic, the writing style, the characters would be acceptable for that time, but now…

The book focuses on bigger countries competing for war dominance, there’s alien invasion, so possibly inviting an unknown to earth, some are against it, some support the idea.
The main themes at hand are interesting: what is humanity’s place in this vast universe, what the future of humanity look like, are humans past the point of redemption.

And while the themes are thought provoking, I wasn’t enjoying this book, it was a roller coaster, I had to push through a lot, I wasn’t invested. I was constantly questioning myself, do I read the same book as everyone else? To be honest, the most questionable hype happens with other genre books, but I’m at a loss here. Nothing special at all.

"I have a love/hate relationship with this book. The start was confusing, the middle was riveting, and I skimmed the end. I really enjoyed the science-y ideas but it was interspersed with info dumps and people monologuing at each other. The mystery-intrigue part was pretty basic. I don't know if that's because I've overdosed on thrillers but it makes me wonder if I was more science fiction fluent, would I have found the science-y bits just as basic and predictable? I haven't seen the Netflix show but I understand why it was made: this is full of great ideas you want to see on screen, and the rest is so mechanical, and straightforward, it's almost like reading a screenplay, in need of actors and sets etc to truly bring it to life.

Let's just say, I liked this enough to put a hold on the sequel at my library but I'm not rushing out to buy a copy any time soon.

"Wissenschaftler in China hatten es damals nicht leicht. Mit der Kulturrevolution wurden sie verfolgt und vieles durften sie einfach nicht mehr lesen oder richtig erforschen. Wir begleiten anfangs die Astrophysikerin Ye Wenjie, die verfolgt wurde, aber durch Glück am den militärischen Stützpunkt ""Rotes Ufer"" kam und dort die Aufgabe hatte Signale ins All zu senden. Später (heutige Zeit) begleiten wir Wang Miao, der eingeladen wurde an einer Sitzung des Militärs mit anderen Wissenschaftlern teilzunehmen. Wir erfahren, dass sich reihenweise Wissenschaftler umbrachten. Danach passieren auch ihm wilde Dinge und was hat das eigentlich mit Aliens zu tun?

Ich hätte nicht gedachte, dass mir das Buch so gut gefällt, da es nicht gerade das ist, wonach ich greife. Aber Liu hat eine tolle Erzählweise - auch wenn ich nichts von Physik und Naturwissenschaften verstehe. Man konnte dem ganzen super folgen und auch die Beweggründe der verschiedenen Akteure waren faszinierend.

Was ich mich aber die ganze Zeit gefragt habe: was macht Wang Miaos Familie eigentlich? Ist er überhaupt noch je bei ihnen?

Ich würde nun auch gerne dehydrieren. Danke.

The end of the book freaked me out like few others have managed, to the point where I definitely want to finish the series because I need to know if and how humanity gets itself out of the trap it's caught in.

Very weird 4 star read. Most of it was really good. The themes and questions in this book are fantastic. Lots to think about. Loved the science. I actually thought the main characters were excellent for the type of book it is. Only thing I was slightly confused by was some of the end, but definitely a very promising setup.

"¿Qué opino de este libro?

Qué tiene un magnetismo inexplicable por la ciencia. Te quedas embelesado, mientras deboras palabras, fingiendo que las entiendes, mientras asientes con la cabeza y tu pelo (el poco que le queda a un servidor), se va encaneciendo de tanto pensar.

Un libro que hace accesible conocimientos que jamás había sospechado que existieran. Un nuevo género en el que me sumerjo, Ciencia-Ciencia-Ciencia-Ficción. Salgo feliz por el realismo, por el peso de las sociedades, por las cuestiones que se entremezclan y por salir tanto de mi zona de confort.

Somos afortunados de no vivir en ciertos lugares con varios soles y eso no pienso dejar de repetirmelo.

Otro gran detalle es que, pese a tener en mis manos la trilogía completa, voy a darle un descanso considerable, para leer Teo en el Zoo, y así dar respiro a mi mente.

Nos seguimos leyendo. Siempre.

"Seksas paplūdimy. Žinot? Bandėt? O kaip Baltasis rusas, ar Kruvinoji Merė – neteko susipažinti? Gal jums labiau prie širdies rožinis Cosmopolitan arba Mojito naktys? Na, jei šių draugijoje neleidote savaitgalio vakarų, tai bent jau apie Aperol Spritz paskutiniais metais turėjot nugirsti. Nors manau, kad visi dabartiniai pilnamečiai yra daugumą šių kokteiliu pavadinimų girdėję, dalį ragavę ir maždaug nutuokia, kas per ingredientai juos sudaro. Nes čia klasika, kurią gamina visi barai. Bet būna tokių madingų nišinių vietelių, kuriose sunku gauti staliuką penktadienį, nes jų barmenai laužia viražus ir siūlo visokius šakar-makar super trendy naujadarus, puikiai atrodančius Instagrame. Mano paskutinis iš tokių eksperimentų buvo kažkoks svaigusis gėrimas su avokadu...

Kuo tos naujosios baro žvaigždės pasižymi? Ogi tuo, kad meniu surašytos sudedamosios dalys tikrai daugiau mažiau pažįstamos (mėgstu sumuštinius su avokadu...), bet kai jas suplaka draugėn supranti, jos iš visos tos kompozicijos tik stiklinė nekelia abejonių.

Tai panašiai yra ir su šia knyga. Atskirai paėmus visi elementai daugiau mažiau aiškūs: istorinis kontekstas svetimas ir nepažintas, tačiau baugiai realistiškas ir įtaigus. Veikėjai... sakykim mums gal kiek per daug mediniai ir emociškai statiški, bet prisiminę tuos keturis-penkis japonų (o gal korėjiečių, o gal tailandiečių, o gal kiniečių, nepamirštant Disnėjaus „Mulan“) filmus, kuriuos vidutiniškai yra matęs vidutinis europietis, tuos bruožus gan lengvai galime nurašyti prie kultūrinių skirtumų. Už tai tikrai daug mokslinės, mokslo, moksliškos fantastikos. Ir dar yra šiek tiek veiksmo. Nepamirškime ir besikeičiančių erdvių: veiksmas vyksta tieks istorinės Kinijos kultūros revoliucijos aplinkoje, tiek dabartyje, tiek itin savotiškame kompiuteriniame žaidime ir netgi toli kosmose. Yra net kelios tikros veiksmo scenos ir keli moksliškai mistiški epizodai. Tik sekso nėra, juolab paplūdimy, bet anoks čia minusas. Už tai yra labai kietas faras, matantis visus kiaurai ir diskusijose siunčiantis į nokautus pačius aukščiausius generolus. Žodžiu visko visko yra čia daug daug.

Ir vis tiek skonis tiek pat pažįstamas kaip alkoholinio kokteilio su avokadais.

Ilgai sukau galvą, kame šaknys. Vienu metu net prisiminiau U. Eco „Fuko švytuoklę“ – panašiai platūs erudicijos horizontai, tik sritis ne istorinė-humanitarinė, o grynai fizikinė-astronominė. Ir vis dėlto tas kitoniškumo prieskonis nenuėjo nuo liežuvio galo, tuo pačiu metu priversdamas ir žavėtis, ir jaustis tik pusiau patenkintai.

Galiausiai nutariau, kad viso to „pusiau“ priežastis yra ta, kad veikėjai čia nesvarbūs, kad rašoma ne veikėjų, o pasaulio istorija ir joje nublanksta atskiri žmonės, o mes, skaitytojai, labai mėgstame su kuo nors tapatintis, tačiau su pasaulio lemtimi tapatintis sunku, todėl ir nėra to kaifo.

Ir tada, paklausiau autoriaus komentarą apie šią knygą ir mane ištiko nušvitimas!!! Liu Cixin pasakojo, kad jis visad manė, jog pačios geriausios istorijos ir patys geriausi siužetai yra sukurtos ne žmogaus, o mokslo, kuris yra gilesnis, keistesnis, įdomesnis, baisesnis, paslaptingesnis ir net emocionalesnis nei visa žmogaus sukurta literatūra. Vos išgirdus tai, man viskas sustojo į vietas: būtent tokią istoriją jis ir kuria. Ne apie veikėjus, ne apie siužetą, ne apie pasaulį. Jis rašo mokslo romaną. Todėl nenuostabu, kad mokslo faktais arba teorijomis grįstos knygos dalys yra pačios paveikiausios ir įdomiausios. Labiausiai intriguojančios savo kitoniškumu it nuostaba, kuri kyla supratus, kad tau įdomu fizika, per kurią simuliavai mokykloje, kad iš astronomijos, kuria domėjaisi tik dėl horoskopų, sukuriama tokia unikali knygos problema. Kad Liu Cixin išties meistriškai traukia siužetą iš mokslo, kuris daugumai toks tolimas ir toks teorinis. Ir būtent dėl to gebėjimo žongliruoti protonais ir nanotechnologijomis, knygos dalis, kuri apie mokslą - gyva ir jaudinanti, o toji, kuri nesiremia jokiais faktais ir jokia apčiuopiama moksline teorija, man pasirodė kažkokia plastmasinė. O kadangi ji, kaip tyčia, yra knygos pabaigoje, tai atslūgo visas literatūrinio atradimo džiaugsmas, nes kai veiksmas persikėlė į Trisoliarį, mano galva ėmė nevalingai tabaluoti į šonus, visiškai subjektyviai nesutikdama su autoriaus pasiūlytu ateivių sociumu.

Žodžiu pabaigai taip: knyga neprimena nieko, ką teko skaityti anksčiau. Yra itin daugialypė ir daugiaplanė, todėl tikimybė rasti patinkančią dalį didelė (deja, statistiškai neišvengiamai didelė rasti ir nepatinkančią). Papildomas medalis už mokslo populiarinimą ir paprastą sudėtingų dalykų paaiškinimą (žmogiškas kompiuteris man buvo visiškai wau momentas). Buvo įdomu (nes kitaip), bet jei būtų tekę skaityti, jaučiu, kad būtų ilgai gulėjusi, todėl labai džiaugiuosi, kad turėjau malonumą paklausyti

"3.5/5

Mi sento sempre in imbarazzo e difficoltà quando leggo un romanzo di nicchia a cui riconosco molti aspetti positivi, ben accolto dalla critica, ma che a me non è piaciuto granché.

L’autore di fantascienza cinese Liu Cixin è molto noto e pluripremiato in patria e trovo una valida idea averlo reso disponibile al pubblico internazionale grazie a questa traduzione in inglese, oltretutto d’eccezione, a firma di Ken Liu.

Ambientato inizialmente durante alcune fasi della Rivoluzione Culturale cinese, il romanzo è incentrato su un programma segreto militare che tenta di stabilre un contatto con gli alieni.
Anni dopo, uno scienziato e un detective della polizia scoprono il risultato di queste azioni, tra le quale il formarsi di un’organizzazione/setta (arruolata tramite una sorta di videogioco chiamato Three Body) che sta collaborando con extraterrestri ostili per aiutarli a consegnare loro il nostro pianeta.

Il sunto della trama è poco significativo, ma a dire il vero l’obiettivo principale del romanzo è solo in parte la storia, marginalmente i personaggi, mentre il vero focus è l’aspetto scientifico.

Già il titolo del romanzo è esemplificativo, dato che è ispirato a un problema della meccanica classica, quello dei tre corpi, appunto.
Questo è solo uno dei temi scientifici, che insieme ad altri (nanotecnologia, ecc.) trovano ampio spazio nel libro, in particolare quando due personaggi stanno provando una soluzione tecnologica, ecco che parte puntualmente la (lunga) disquisizione scientifica (“spiegone” di alto livello – purtroppo la tendenza a spiegare più che all’azione o altro è una caratteristica del romanzo). Benché esposti abbastanza chiaramente, chi non ha una certa base (*alzo per prima la mano*) in materia, può trovarsi un pochino spiazzato o in difficoltà.
Personalmente apprezzo i libri che contengono sì parti speculative, ma dipende molto come sono calibrate nella trama. In questo caso, per me hanno parecchio appesantito la lettura e interrotto l’andamento del climax.

Lo stile del romanzo ricorda molto la golden age della fantascienza, Clarke e Asimov su tutti, pur affrontando anche tematiche più contemporanee, naturalmente. Anche questo, se da un lato è positivo, mi ha un po’ lasciato meh (forse perché amo i classici quando sono classici, di ogni genere e tempo).

Come accennavo, le idee di base sono molto interessanti. A parte la scienza, si tratta di aspetti sociali, di propaganda e ideologia, di ambiente e progresso, dei vari modi con i quali gli esseri umani si comportano in vista della futura probabile invasione aliena dal pianeta Trisolaris – analisi notevole, che mette a nudo, alla fine, le paure e le speranze dell’uomo di fronte all’ignoto, che sia una minaccia o un miraggio salvifico, direi una delle parti che ho preferito del libro.

Anche l’idea del videogioco multiplayer come strumento di reclutamento è molto suggestiva, tanto più che in questo modo ci viene mostrato il pianeta Trisolaris, la sua evoluzione e le sue problematiche, benché come tecnicamente il gioco venga presentato e trattato un po’ goffamente e con poca verosimiglianza. In più, dopo averci accompagnato lungo vari livelli (corrispondenti alle ère trascorse su Trisolaris), per accelerare il finale viene utilizzato un espediente alquanto ingenuo.

La specie aliena ha parecchi punti di vista interessanti, talora sembra metafora di ideologie o aspetti dell’umanità stessa. A mio avviso, però, verso la fine gli abitanti di Trisolaris diventano troppo simili agli esseri umani e trovo sia narrativamente una pecca − già è sempre inverosimile trattare di qualcosa al di fuori dell’esperienza umana, ma applicare a degli alieni, descritti come molto diversi da noi per storia ed esperienza, tratti psicologici alla fine troppo a noi simili non mi ha convinto.

I protagonisti, in tutto questo, soffrono. Sono mero strumento della trama, un po’ piatti, non hanno una vera caratterizzazione, un approfondimento psicologico e una crescita interiore – o, meglio, tutto questo c’è, ma in minima dose, non sufficiente a renderli individui.

Credo, tuttavia, che tante cose da me evidenziate e non apprezzate fino in fondo, siano dovute alla discrepanza culturale.
Il romanzo, si percepisce, vive e respira della società cinese e non è semplice per noi occidentali capire fino in fondo (sarebbe meglio dire “empatizzare”) con una realtà così differente, in particolare quella descritta negli anni della Rivoluzione Culrurale.

Concludendo, trovo sia un romanzo interessante, di sicuro diverso dal solito, ricco di temi ed idee valide, benché, a mio gusto, con alcune pecche che lo rendono non di immediata gradevolezza.

"The Three-Body Problem just won the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Novel.
The Hugo Award website noted, ""The Three-Body Problem was originally published in Chinese in 2008. The 2014 publication by Tor was the first English-language version, and therefore it is again eligible for the Hugos[.]"" 2015 Hugo Awards



cau·sal·i·ty (kôˈzalədē) noun
1. the relationship between cause and effect.
2. the principle that everything has a cause.

I mention cause and effect as an underlying theme of the novel because Liu Cixin goes to great effort to have his characters, his new worlds and his science to not just drop out of the blue. Arguably this is just good writing (i.e. character motivation,) but for science, cause and effect is a basic imperative. The story unfolds like a spiral of cause/effect events bordering on destiny.

The nation of China was turned upside down during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960's, education and learning became entirely political and students took the lead in 'reeducating' the teachers. Intellectuals were targeted as a source of deviance and Western Capitalist subversion. While changing the interpretation of history may be a small matter of politically correct textbook editing, changing the conclusion of math and science is no small matter for Physics Professor Ye Zhetai. There can only be one answer with math, unwilling to bend, he is broken.

Ye Wenjie witnessed the death of her father Ye Zhetai, the suicide of her mentor Professor Ruan Wen, and the decline of her mother into a blathering idiot. Ye Wenjie is banished to the country and put to work chopping down trees. Time passes but Ye Wenjie is ultimately tasked to help with a secret government space project in no small part because her science training is critically needed because the revolution killed off the best science talent. Cause and Effect.

So it is a serious twist of fate that when the most crucial turning point in human history arrived it was disenfranchised Ye standing in a crucial spot. Cixin Liu writes,


This is real science fiction, the three-body mathematics problem is described by Wikipedia as

Liu Cixin takes this mathematical problem as a starting point and builds a plot around Ye Wenjie that touches most immediately on virtual reality games. But his clever story quickly mushrooms into the science of interstellar communication, multiple dimensions, computer logic, nano technology, political and religious dogma and much more.

We also get much of the story from the p.o.v. scientist Wang Miao. He is Liu Cixin's ""everyman"" protagonist, he is not real compelling character by himself, rather he is a uninformed normal individual in the center of these many odd swirling events. (BTW, apparently there is real Chinese math Professor, Wang Quidong, who extended the math of the three-body problem to more than three bodies. Author's shout-out?)

Cause and Effect. Ye Wenjie has a cause for her actions. Even the alien culture is a product of their environment. Makes me wonder about predestination and freewill, though, Liu Cixin does not speak to that issue but there is a certain inevitability of his logic. The author, with his connection to the Cultural Revolution, builds from the premise that humanity would not unite during alien first contact, as many suppose, but rather would divide into factions with misplaced religious dogma, like it seemingly does for everything else.

A solid work of science fiction. No need to understand the science to enjoy the story. Perhaps it will inspire some further reading! Like me googling the three-body problem and quickly reading the Wikipedia article.

"I finally read this due to two recommendations in the same week, and I had a good time! I liked how imaginative the science was, and I liked that it was partially set during the Cultural Revolution, which is a time period I know very little about. But the characters were so flat that it was hard for me to really get into.

I suppose you could argue that hard sci fi doesn't need strong characterization, but the issue is that a few major characters independently make life-altering decisions that affect the future of humanity. If that's part of the plot, you need to buy into the characters' motivation. You also need to be able to differentiate between them (for example, the only difference between Lei and Yang is that one of them wears glasses, and I could never remember which). I think an adaptation of this book might be more successful in building out the characters and making them believable, so I'm excited for the upcoming Netflix series.

"Tôi không muốn nói nhiều đến nội dung cuốn sách nữa mà muốn nói đến một ý tưởng mà bộ sách nhen nhóm trong tôi. Các bạn đã bao giờ nghe đến nghịch lý Fermi chưa? Đơn giản, nghịch lý này gợi cho chúng ta một câu hỏi: ""Người ngoài hành tinh có thật không, nếu có thì họ đang ở đâu rồi?"". Chúng ta, những cư dân của Địa Cầu, luôn đau đáu nhìn về vũ trụ ngoài kia, tự hỏi có nền văn minh nào khác như chúng ta hay không? Mỗi một sự nhảy vọt trong khoa học vũ trụ giúp chúng ta nhận ra mình vẫn đơn độc, có thể ta buồn đấy nhưng không khỏi tự hào vì chúng ta là độc nhất vô nhị! Nghịch lý Fermi nói với chúng ta rằng, chúng ta nên lo nhiều hơn là buồn hay vui đấy. Tại sao ư? Vấn đề là thế này, có 2 trường hợp để trả lời cho câu hỏi ở trên. Trường hợp đầu tiên, nếu người ngoài hành tinh không có thật, nhưng chúng ta thì đang ở đây. Có nghĩa là chúng ta là nền văn minh đầu tiên trong toàn vũ trụ rộng lớn này đã đạt đến trình độ đủ để nhận thức về vị trí của mình trong cõi hư vô. Chúng ta cũng có thể là nền văn minh dẫn đầu, các nền văn minh khác có thể vẫn đang tập nói trong khi chúng ta đã bay lượn bét nhè rồi, quá tuyệt vời.
Thế trong trường hợp thứ hai, họ có thật, thế tại sao sau bao nhiêu cuộc tìm kiếm và mọi cách thức liên lạc tốn kém nhiều năm qua, chúng ta vẫn không phát hiện ra một ""người bạn cùng lớp"" nào? Đây là cái đáng lo đây này. Nếu họ có tồn tại, chúng ta không tìm ra họ, họ không tìm ra chúng ta, thế liệu nền văn minh của họ còn hiện hữu hay không? Có lẽ chỉ có sự diệt vong mới giải thích được cho việc trí tò mò (một dấu hiệu nhận biết của trí tuệ bậc cao) không xuất hiện ở các nền văn minh đó nữa. Và nếu họ phát triển hơn chúng ta (nếu kém thì ở trường hợp 1 rồi), thì họ diệt vong vì cái gì? Nghịch lý Fermi gọi nguyên nhân diệt vong của nền văn minh khác đó là bức tường tiến hóa. Có lẽ họ đã tiến hóa chạm đến bức tường đó nhưng không vượt qua được và họ cứ thế thành tàn tro mà thôi. Chúng ta thì sao, bức tường đó liệu có ở phía trước kia không? Và câu hỏi quan trọng đây: Sẽ thế nào nếu bức tường tiến hóa của một nền văn minh, chính là một nền văn minh khác cao cấp hơn?
Chúng ta hãy nên tin tưởng là ở Vũ trụ bao la ngoài kia, có những nền văn minh khác, kém hơn chúng ta cũng có mà phát triển hơn chúng ta cũng có. Thế nhưng việc chúng ta liên tục tìm cách liên lạc với họ có thực sự thông minh? Một kẻ đứng ở bậc thang cao hơn của sự tiến hóa sẽ đối xử thế nào với một kẻ đứng thấp hơn mình nếu bất ngờ gặp được ở Thế giới tự nhiên? Để trả lời câu hỏi này, các bạn hãy tự tìm hiểu lịch sử của Thế giới chúng ta, ở cái thời mà loài HomoSapiens đã khiến cho những tộc người kém phát triển hơn như Homo Neanderthal biến mất và bị đồng hóa thế nào. Chúng ta tốt nhất nên làm mọi cách để nền văn minh của mình tiến xa hơn và luôn trong tâm thế chuẩn bị của một người đi săn, đừng để rơi vào thế bị động của một con mồi!

"Where are those Stable Eras?

We have a long list of holocausts---Armenians, Cambodians, Jews, and Rwandans for a start---but that’s only in the last century or so. Then we had slavery, the decimation of the Native Americans throughout the two continents, two huge wars with immense death and destruction, and let’s not forget all the other wars which have incessantly raised their ugly heads in history. Let’s add hunger, disease, discrimination of all kinds, and the craziness of religion or politics spinning out of “normal channels”. What kind of world is this? In the disaster which was the Cultural Revolution in China, millions of people died or went through hell, cruelty and fanaticism abounded. It wouldn’t be surprising if some of the innocent victims ultimately thought that the human race was stupid, evil, and deserved to be wiped out. If there were aliens out there somewhere, maybe they’d be better inhabitants of our beautiful planet, which we are steadily destroying like termites in an old wooden house. Those who did not suffer badly would probably think otherwise. That’s the theme of THE THREE-BODY PROBLEM. With over twelve thousand reviews here, I definitely am not going to go over the plot!!

Loaded with physics (which I am not capable of checking), this unusual Chinese novel wanders through many halls, perhaps of a castle too big to be totally understandable. It is the first volume of a trilogy, easily read if you don’t try to grasp every concept or scientific detail that flashes past. You will run into video games, physics, a cigar-smoking, foul-mouthed Chinese cop, an American billionaire who plants forests in China, Chinese politics, and a strange planet by Alpha Centauri with three suns which cause the effects that lead to our title. The three suns cause Stable and Chaotic Eras on the planet in sequences that are almost impossible to predict; hence the title. It seems to me that we are beginning a Chaotic Era right here on earth, but it has nothing to do with the sun.

I used to be a big fan of science fiction, but for the last 25 years or so I have almost totally turned towards other genres. I have given this book four stars from the point of view of science fiction, not of literature in general. I think it was a difficult book to translate and there are a few places where perhaps Chinese readers would “fill in the blanks” automatically, but non-Chinese might be left wondering. Never mind. If you like science fiction, this is a really good opportunity to enter another future, created with some wild imagination. Being a trilogy, the three body problem for you may be that you don’t want to read all three.

"Liu Cixin
The Three-Body Problem
Tor Books
400 pages
8.7 (Best Book)

In The Three-Body Problem Liu entertains his reader with a convincing speculative fiction about the battle between alien and human being without any clank or boom. It's quiet, but exhilarating.

The firmament above is disgustingly vast. It's steadfast, yet dynamic at the same time. You can always rely on stars above to get some direction, but at the same time the universe expands. We all move at the speed of light toward the big rip, one of the theories that speculate the end of the universe. There's a lot of mystery that's yet to be unveiled in the universe.

Compared to other science fiction works that tend to jump on galaxy far far away (I'm looking at you, Star Wars), Liu is humbler. He explores the closest star from the sun: Alpha Centauri. But even though it's just less than five years light away from our solar system, we still haven't figured out what's going on there. Liu believes there's a vicious alien race lurking in the Alpha Centaurian system, a stellar system that has three stars called Trisolaris. The movement of the stars is unpredictable, a representation of the three-body problem in physics world, and their civilization is about to end. Meanwhile on the earth's surface, the first contact to the alien has been established clandestinely. ventures the pre-beginning of a galactic star wars from the perspective of a human being.

Liu straight away begins the book with a brief history of Chinese Revolution that's bloody and heartbreaking, but this cemented the story. It explains the background of each character, and what they have gone through prior the first contact. Fast forward to decades later, new characters are introduced, yet they're still interconnected with the old ones.

is wrapped with mystery, and that's what makes you keep turning the pages. Starting from the mystery of scientists' suicide, until the mystery behind the Trisolaris system, you will be enticed by the beauty of the book. Don't shiver when you see the title of the book that's heavy with physics element. It's not light definitely, but the way Liu explains the theory and apothegms is easy to understand. And again, what differs this book from other sci-fi works is actually how close to the earth it is. It's a war against alien, but Liu writes it from the eye of human. That even though humanity is on the brink of destruction, there are some people who actually wish for the destruction itself. It makes you think, there's some contemplative quality from .

"Първо и най-важно! Адмирации и благодарности за безупречния превод на Стефан Русинов.

""In the face of madness, rationality was powerless.""

This book left me sleepless both while reading and after. I was obsessed. Its plot and philosophical musings were captivating and gave me a lot of food for thought.
While leaving out certain important aspects to avoid spoilers, I will attempt to touch on some of the things that made this book worth five stars in my humble opinion.

The book will appeal to the lovers of classic Sci-Fi books, as it deals with many issues of our society, in particular its self destructive nature, with ambition, ignorance, fear, greed and despair as some of its major drivers. Characters struggle against these forces and fall into extremism or numbness.

""It was impossible to expect a moral awakening from humankind itself, just like it was impossible to expect humans to lift off the earth by pulling up on their own hair. To achieve moral awakening required a force outside the human race.""

While the above issues are recurring themes in science fiction, Liu Cixin gives us a new historical and cultural perspective - China. Having lived through the Cultural Revolution and following opening policies of Deng Xiaoping, the author builds an incredibly realistic world of power struggles, human pain, and scientific aspirations. One might argue, that his characters are somehow underdeveloped, but I would rather say they carry the scars of censorship.

""Every era puts invisible shackles on those who have lived through it, and I can only dance in my chains.""

Furthermore, I was amazed at how easy it was to read a book full of scientific concepts and technical language. The original use of language and metaphors built a vivid picture of abstract ideas and human emotions.

""In China, any idea that dared to take flight would only crash back to the ground. The gravity of reality is too strong.""

Lastly, this book deals with a topic close to my heart - environmental protection. It made me contemplate about the value of life and how it can depend on the perspective and personal experiences of an individual.

""Why are you all like this?” Evans suddenly became furious. “Why does one have to save people to be considered a hero? Why is saving other species considered insignificant? Who gave humans such high honors?""

The only issue I had with the book was the predominantly negative outlook on human nature. Even though I did not resonate with the Machiavellian views expressed here, I still think the book is a masterpiece in its genre, and that it could be an enriching experience for anyone, so I strongly recommend it.

"In a tale that begins during the Cultural Revolution and continues into the future, various seemingly random scientists make disturbing discoveries. Eventually it becomes clear that this is all related to
factions on Earth that are trying to prepare the planet for an alien invasion. The alien fleet (termed Trisolarians because their world suffers through the seemingly chaotic movements of a solar system with three suns) is still four hundred years away, but select misanthropes have convinced themselves that it's best that another force dictates humanity's fate.

Some plot points that made no sense are eventually cleared up--
. Some of the illogical decisions can be explained by human fallacy
, but so many poorly thought out plot points add up. The overall plot of warring factions on each planet is just not well developed enough to bear up under these minor points, or the truly terrible writing. The pacing is a real problem--the first three hundred pages are a real slog, with little to no action, and then the last hundred pages is bloody action interspersed with chapters worth of infodumps and characters explaining their entire plans (which is needed, because the plans are generally at-odds with their expected outcomes). No character, save perhaps Ye, comes across as fully realized. The characters are just names that spout dialog (none of it even close to natural speech) and infodumps (often regardless of their ostensible skills or training). Dialog is generally blocks of paragraphs. The action scenes are an odd combination of gory (lots of things happen to organs in this book) and dispassionate and unhurried. The ""twists"" at the end are the sort that are necessary but also incredibly expected. Altogether, it's just so very clunky that I had a hard time not hating this book.

"Finalmente li ""The Three-Body Problem"" do chinês Liu Cixin. Quando saiu em inglês, no final de 2014 e ganhou o Hugo 2015, despertou-me uma curiosidade imensa, por vir classificado como Hard SF e de uma geografia culturalmente distante, a China. A somar a tudo isto o título fazia-me pensar constantemente no ""problema mente-corpo"" — à data desconhecia o ""problema dos três corpos"" — despertando a ideia de que estaria perante uma obra de grande fulgor filosófico. Terminada a leitura, muitas das minhas expectativas saíram goradas, criando um sabor amargo na experiência. Confesso que não ajudou ter criado tantas expectativas, mas também não ajudou tanto cliché narrativo decalcado da tradicional FC americana. Faltou-me exoticismo cultural, mas acima de tudo faltou-me elevação discursiva. Sim, muitos conceitos debatidos — a variação e constância da dinâmica — são brilhantemente expostos, ainda que de algum modo com excesso de redundância, mas quando se entra pelos mundos Nano e Pico adentro, pelas cordas e não-dimensionalidade, é tudo demasiado superficial, serve apenas a complexificação da trama que acaba por terminar numa espécie de banal romance policial.


Compreendo o entusiasmo na receção à obra, dada a geografia e o sucesso do autor no seu país. Confesso também que Cixin apesar de ter uma escrita regular, sabe gerir muito bem o suspense e despertar a curiosidade fazendo com que viremos páginas atrás de páginas. Sim, a escrita socorre-se excessivamente de exposição falhando na dramatização (o chamado tell-show), mas isso não perturba a leitura uma vez que o autor coze muito bem a informação e nos mantém sempre engajados até ao final.

Assim, se gostei imenso do ambiente inicial assente na história da Revolução Cultural chinesa, ou ainda do videojogo RV, que Cixin usa fundamentalmente para a exposição de conceitos, desgostei imenso toda a trama muito básica de vinganças, ataques, invasões e insectos, etc. Desgostei, como não poderia deixar de ser, seguir atrás de personagens que olham para o desconhecido com o único desejo de se vingarem naqueles que os maltrataram. De personagens, que se colocam no extremismo oposto à Revolução, e se assumem acima do comum humano por via do mero intelecto, algo que pode talvez fazer sentido na rebeldia dos 16/17 anos. Mais, considero que Cixin passou a linha vermelha ao colocar a protagonista no lugar de assassina, ignorando totalmente a moralidade da conduta.

"3.5-star rating.

With The Three-Body Problem, first in a trilogy, readers in the West are at last getting to sample the work of Liu Cixin, mainland China’s most popular science fiction superstar. Given a graceful and accessible translation by multi-award winning author Ken Liu for its 2014 US release, it’s a unique tale of first contact and alien invasion set against the tumultuous political history of Liu’s homeland and the most mind-bending speculative frontiers of theoretical physics. It’s far from perfect, but in its best moments is so unlike anything hard SF has thrown at us before that no dedicated reader of the genre should overlook it.

The story opens in the heat of the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, where Ye Wenjie, the young daughter of a prominent professor of physics, witnesses her father beaten to death by Red Guard fanatics. The event sears itself not only into her memory but her very psyche, as she channels her anger into a state of emotional numbness and becomes more or less a misanthrope. Years later, her own political loyalties suspect, she is conscripted into working at Red Coast, a secret government radio telecommunications facility that she is initially told exists to detect and disable the satellites of enemy nations. Its real purpose is far more fantastic. And when she discovers a clear and unambiguous message from an extraterrestrial intelligence, she is faced with a fateful decision: can she actually take it upon herself to help cleanse the Earth of a morally irredeemable human race and usher in what she believes will be its redemption via conquest?

This premise, and the electrifying early chapters that relate most of it, alone make The Three-Body Problem essential reading. They provide a window into a world of political upheaval most of us in the West have inadequate knowledge and appreciation of, for one thing. And for another, they reveal some disturbing parallels to the present day that I found deeply frightening. For while we aren’t exactly at the point where we’re publicly murdering intellectuals and scientists just yet, we are seeing a politically and ideologically driven hostility towards science in what we like to think is our own free and enlightened Western society right now.

But the book is uneven. The majority of its characters are either weakly developed or not especially developed at all. ()

"Wow. A true ""hard science fiction"" book if I've ever read one, this one is worthy of the praise it's been getting. A story centered around the well-known ""three body problem"" you might remember from physics class, it's hard to say much about the plot without spoiling it. There is one item I didn't think was resolved enough in the book (see spoiler below) but all in all, this was a fantastic story that had me staying up past my bedtime every night until I finished. The characters were interesting, though not so developed that time was ""wasted"" talking about them. The story really is about the story and the characters are a vehicle for it. A book about a physics problem wouldn't really work with marketing people as the characters, but having the characters be scientists (mostly) made it familiar (for me anyway). The concept was fascinating and I am interested to see what the sequel holds, whether it is a near-future (with respect to the events in this book) sequel or one set 450 years for the events in the book. Either way, the sequel is not necessary, as the book stands very well on its own. It's also interesting that I found the book to be fairly tight, fairly fast-moving. I associate this kind of no-frills writing with Chinese works in general, and the book still stands up without needing a lot of exposition. The end felt like a little bit of an info dump, but at least the info dump made sense in the context of the story.

I know this is a bit scattered, I intend to possibly write more when I'm on a real computer/keyboard, not just the on-screen keyboard on my iPad. Either way, read it, especially if you actually know enough math/physics to understand the three body problem. But even if you don't have that math background, the story explains it all pretty well in what seemed to me easy enough to understand language (I might be biased based on what I studied in school...).

"February 1st 2024 update: After finishing the series, which is its own story why I did, I don't feel the same way as written here. This remains one of the ones I'm least happy about having posted, but that's just how it is. I'm symbolically upgrading it to 2.5 rounded down because I don't know whether it'd be going too far to raise it to three without rereading and then rewriting what I've written.

Original review follows
----
I was irrationally upset when I wrote this the day before and thought I'd want to change it, but apparently not.

I almost didn't finish this multiple times. During the reading I found there to be much that was disagreeable and unenjoyable on all levels. After I had finished and began to think about what I had read and started to write this, it changed to anger. I haven't been this angry from reading a book in many years and it wasn't even an enjoyable kind of anger.

The characters are all awful, the prose was disagreeable, the plot was bothersome, the various thought experiments didn't interest me, and there was an excessive amount of scientific infodumping.

The Three-Body game is literally a
. The one thing that I cannot forgive is seeing humanity as irredeemable and needing to be saved by an external power greater than ourselves, which in this case, as in some other books I've read,
.

Just as bad, if not worse, is having the solution be that humanity must go extinct because it's what we deserve. To me the thought experiments were basically ""paranormal hard sci-fi"", which may well be a oxymoron though what I mean by it is that they are so ridiculous in that to seriously entertain them would be an exercise in madness, similar to serious discussion and sincere belief in Roko's Basilisk. I deplore the idea of pan-species communism. Everything about the ETO is terrible.

Despite the declarations about the quality of the second book, it's very unlikely that I would enjoy it so it's equally unlikely that I will ever read it. Based on where it seems to be go, I also have no interest in that either. It's not my sort of bleakness.

My disappointment is immense, but not unexpected.

"This book was a definite eye-opener.

First of all, it falls in the hard-science-fiction category (then keeps drilling down just to see how the earth's core looks like :) ). The subjects it tackles range from multi-dimensional string theory, to graphene-like nano-materials, to questions about the limits of scientific understanding. There are a lot of very recent scientific and technological breakthroughs used as plot devices and they work very well together. The plot and the characters fulfil their role adequately, but the main driver of this book is the science.

With that part out of the way, what really caught my attention - and opened my eyes to a part of human history I was completely ignorant about - are all the references to the Cultural Revolution in China. The very personal point of view from which the events of the Cultural Revolution are described left a very powerful impression on me. I must definitely look for other works to find out more details about this period in Chinese history.

There were a few quirks in the plot and some interesting characters were given only minor roles, but all in all it is a very promising start to a trilogy which should span 450 years into the future. The trilogy, after all, is called , so I guess the epicness can only get bigger.

P.S. - Two rants

One disappointment was that The Frontiers of Science organisation did not make it to the end of the book. I couldn't understand if it morphed into the Earth-Trisolaris Organization or just diminished in importance and popped out of existence by the end of the novel.

Secondly, the author states in his notes, at the end of the book, that rationality and science can drive a story better than myths. I tend to disagree with this statement because in all my readings I can't remember even one example of a story which didn't make use of character archetypes borrowed from oral myths and legends. is the perfect example in this book. He borrows a lot from the trickster archetype (having a specific type of intelligence, rebellious, thinking outside the box) and, consequently, becomes a fan favourite.

"The Three-Body Problem, by Liu Cixin, is a fascinating piece of science fiction that has made waves both in China and in translation in the West. This book spans from the Cultural Revolution to about modern time, and has one of the most engrossing hard-sf plots I have experience. I have read one of Liu Cixin's work before (Ball Lightening), and it similarly has a tone and feel that revolve much more on math, engineering and real science than most science fiction, all while creating an engaging and engrossing story. This book follows two characters, one a woman working on an experimental radar station in Inner Mongolia during the Cultural Revolution, and the other, a scientist tasked by global leaders with infiltrating a mysterious organization bent on stopping human scientific progress. This book features some fascinating concepts; the mysteries of the universe, alternate realities, human scientific progress, and deep learning philosophy that is quite mind bending. Liu explores concepts from a truly scientific background, utilizing radio frequency numbers, math problems and theory, light spectrum and more to create a very hard-sf focused on first contact.

I liked this book quite a bit, and am looking forward to continuing this series. I always have some trouble empathizing with Liu's characters - they are much to rational for me to feel like they are real people, although this sometimes adds to his works mystique. What I do love is the mystery and speculative wonder of his works. His plots and outcomes are always quite exhilarating, and feel visceral and real, much having to do with the high quality science that goes into his work. A very interesting read, and in my opinion worth the hype. This book may turn off those looking for gooier science fiction, as this one is ground in logic and fact, blurring the lines between what the reader knows is true, and what the reader finds unbelievable. Sometimes the science fiction is actually fact, and sometimes its the speculative stuff that is really science fiction. All in all, a very good read, and I am looking forward to the next in this series.

"so good. A few things:
- I've never had to use such a high percentage of my education to understand such a low percentage of the concepts presented in a work of fiction. Nonetheless, the author does a good job of explaining the theories in such a way to advance the plot. He does it so well that the conceptual complexity was probably the defining strength of the book, rather than a hindrance. For most of us (myself included) though, I'd recommend having your favorite search engine on hand.
- Pretty dark book. I think Liu/Liu did a good job of giving voice to the despair that some feel in response to the tragedy of human evil, and the need for deliverance in something Other. As a religious person, I get that need.
- The rooting in the Chinese Cultural revolution was important, too, I thought. I that it's not something too high on most Americans' history radar - at least I wasn't taught about it through school. So I think it's good that the book sheds some light on a particularly dark period in recent Chinese history. The lessons that history teaches are manifold (by the way, did you know that Animal Farm was written some two decades before the Cultural Revolution ever happened? And yet it's a perfect allegory (it was written in response to the goings on in the Soviet Union). George Orwell - what a guy).
- Given the two middle points, don't think that the book is merely a commentary on humanity - it's much more than that. In fact, the author goes out of his way to tell us in a note at the end that this is not his intention. It's a really creative work, and despite being dark, it's also fun.

"Having read Snow Crash recently, I immediately thought of it during the VR aspects of the book. That's pretty much where the comparison starts and ends. I enjoyed the VR aspects in this book a lot more. The use of popular historical figures was an interesting touch. It put a lot of what the characters said in a familiar aspect. These segments were my favorite part.

As other reviewers mentioned, the first half of the book is tough to get through, but the second half flies by. Somehow, it feels exciting with what seems like one real action scene. A lot of the ideas here revolve around the idea of social guilt. As a result, there are a few different factions in relation to the alien planet that is the forefront of this story. I honestly don't know who to side with.

This book is a good introduction to the series. Whether I'll continue it or not, I haven't decided yet. I think the hype surrounding it has raised my expectations to levels that the book never came close to. As a stand-alone novel, it leaves a lot to be desired. I'm open to the idea of reading the second installment, but I'm not going to be rushing to do so any time soon. Maybe if the characters were a bit more likable and there was more action, I'd instantly hop aboard the Trisolarian Express.

"I am struggling to rate this one. It took me almost a full month to get through it, as chapters 1 through 28 dragged considerably. But then, but then! The last 10 were fascinating and I was so immersed.

So, we’re left with 3 stars.

The pros include learning more about the Chinese Cultural Revolution (why were we not taught about this in school??), an innovative alien race, and some serious hard science (which, in my humble opinion, is severely lacking in most popular sci-fi).

The cons include the first 75% of the novel reading like a textbook, empty characters, and a confusing timeline. How much of this is due to being a translation? I have no idea. But seeing as I’ll never be able to read the original text, it seems useless to dwell on that factor.

Overall, I liked it. The end made the slog of the beginning and middle worth it. But oh how I wish that beginning and middle had been half as long.

I’d recommend this to anyone looking for some hard adult sci-fi that analyzes communism, totalitarianism, and the connection between religion and technological development in a unique way.

Trigger warning for murder and gore.

"Wow, this was deep. Astro-physics, impossible scientific scenarios with no solutions, deep-space probes the size of photons, and science fiction set in and around China's Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s through the modern era.

This is deep-thought science fiction, and probably not for everybody. I listened to this one, and I'm glad I did; I don't think I would have finished this in print/ebook format.

The plot is sometimes slow-going, with the physics-related explanations often slowing down the narrative dramatically, with whole chapters dedicated to explaining various happenings in the real world, in virtual space, and on another planet. The world-building is simply fantastic, though, and it was actually quite fun (and challenging) to try to picture a planet with three suns in chaos with each other.

I'll be listening to the next one soon, but I need to give my mind a break!

"3.5/5. I am not sure how I feel about this book.
One one hand, the science part had me fascinated. This book is unlike anything I've ever read before and the uniqueness of the plot and the way it's executed captivated me from the very beginning. It had me guessing all the time and even made me miss my days as a Physics student.
On the other hand though, the characters are weak and forgettable and there is practically no development.
For me, characters are the foremost element of anything I read. The science or the fantasy elements come second. And that is where I felt this book could have done better. Maybe it was just the translation making me feel like that but I don't know. I never trust translations to capture the essence of the original work anyway.
So, yeah. I don't really know how I feel about this book. I guess I'm just more of a soft Sci Fi guy. That said, definitely gonna finish the trilogy.

Няма да крия, че много ми хареса факта, че действието се развива в Китай. Голяма част от действието преминава в разказ за живота и кариерата на една от главните героини, покрай който научаваме и доста за културната революция в Китай. Авто��ът умело е преплел историческите събития с научно-техническия прогрес и идеята за извънземна цивилизация.

"Cixin Liu's ""The Three-Body Problem"" is a stunning work of science fiction that transports readers on an epic journey spanning decades and galaxies. With its intricate plot, complex characters, and mind-bending concepts, this novel captivates the imagination and pushes the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of speculative fiction.

Liu establishes a sense of wonder and intrigue. The story unfolds against the backdrop of China's tumultuous history, seamlessly blending historical events with a deeply imaginative and thought-provoking narrative. Liu's meticulous attention to detail creates a rich and immersive world, where scientific theories merge with cultural nuances, resulting in a unique reading experience that transcends time and space.

One of the book's standout features is Liu's ability to seamlessly weave together scientific concepts and philosophical inquiries. Drawing upon real scientific theories, Liu explores the enigmatic world of physics, astrophysics, and quantum mechanics. His descriptions of complex scientific phenomena are both accessible and awe-inspiring, providing readers with a window into the vastness and intricacies of the universe. Moreover, Liu delves into existential questions, the nature of humanity, and the potential consequences of our actions, challenging readers to ponder the ethical and philosophical implications of scientific progress.

The novel's plot is a masterful tapestry of suspense, mystery, and scientific discovery. Liu expertly builds tension, slowly unraveling the layers of a grand cosmic puzzle. The intricate plotting and intricately interconnected threads keep readers guessing and engrossed until the final page. The narrative seamlessly shifts between different time periods and perspectives, weaving together historical events, scientific breakthroughs, and moments of awe-inspiring wonder. The pacing is masterful, allowing the story to unfold at a controlled yet gripping pace.

It is not just a story of science and mystery; it is a story that explores the complexities of human nature and the consequences of our choices. Liu examines the interplay between science, ideology, and human ambition, challenging readers to confront the moral dilemmas that arise when humanity encounters the unknown.

In conclusion, ""The Three-Body Problem"" is a tour de force of science fiction that pushes the boundaries of imagination and intellectual inquiry. Cixin Liu's ability to blend science, history, and philosophy in a captivating narrative is truly remarkable.

"So you’ve already got two streaming series to choose from here, if you want to see how well this novel translates to the small screen, the newer Netflix version, which is fantastic, albeit not very true to the book’s material, creating a cast of many new characters, including Samwell Tarley and the Onion Knight and setting the majority of the action in the West (although not Westeros), and the original Chinese version available on Prime, which is far more faithful to Liu’s text, and thus much much slower paced with fewer bells and whistles to the point of teetering on the edge of creating some potential boredom at times.

Not that it’s a boring book…I live next door to Fermi Lab and quantum physics fascinates me, as do aliens and the prospect of first contact…I’m just not very smart, and Liu’s book is, for lack of a better word, quite “science-y,” and thus I found myself out of my depths in a few places, especially in the last fifty pages or so where the author devotes a lot of time to the concept of the Sophon, and I had a hard time keeping up. But that’s on me, not Liu, although I do wish he had thought harder about the shape of his book and built it toward a more intense climax at the end, instead of bogging down in the details of the Sophon. However, as this is a trilogy and there is much left, that looked-for climax is no doubt forthcoming and I shall have to be patient and keep reading.

And lest you be dissuaded here from reading the book because science fiction just is not your thing, well, that’s a stupid position for a reader to take, but Liu frames the context of these contemporary sci-fi events in the historical details of the Cultural Revolution, and that aspect of the novel is as equally fascinating as the physics and extraterrestrials, and never bogs down into boredom. Interestingly, while the Netflix series does a great job illustrating the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese series downplays them, understandably so, but still quite disappointing.

"SECOND READING
I just reread this novel. I had read it and the sequel, The Dark Forest (Chinese: 黑暗森林), but not the concluding volume. I finally wrested time for #3 and wanted to refresh my memory of the setup.

So, observations from a second go, or, heh, remembering starting Remembrance. And there will be spoilers.

has a seriously dark theme from start to finish. Nothing so cataclysmic as the end of , but strong nonetheless. We begin with a daughter witnessing her father being beaten to death by Red Guards in China's Cultural Revolution, which stamps her mind with the conviction that humanity is irredeemable. Ye starts the novel and ends it in blood-red, decaying triumph.

Liu Cixin writes with almost manic delight in ideas, throwing out concepts and plot developments in a hurry. We start with a killing, then jump to mysterious big science, then the world is in a secret war and it's just page 53! And some of the ideas fascinate me, like the Trisolarian body dehydration or the use of the sun as radio reflector.

The author also loves sf. He knows and uses the tropes, even citing an Isaac Asimov short story. (70)

The titular game remains interesting. Like The Last Starfighter it's a video game that's really a recruitment tool. There are some ARG and LARP elements as well, such as meetups.,

This is very much a hard science tale. There are lengthy and serious discussions about science problems: how to create a digital computer using, ah, analog components; how long it takes a fleet to cross four light years. And the text uses science as metaphor, making human details more clear through scientific concepts. One character's emotions are like a Geiger counter, and another's personality is like a DOS prompt (92). One point receives a footnote to a scholarly article (199).

There are some fine set pieces, like Wang encountering the universal countdown or the filament attack on the ETO ship or the Trisolarians' development of the Sophon (that giant eye!). Or the ""You're bugs!"" line - and the reactions.

The antagonists appear more scary to me this time, or more negative, perhaps because of 's conclusion. I'd forgotten just how nightmarish a society they achieve before launching the Earth invasion. They've got extensive killing of ""the idle"" (350), massive emotional repression (352), and a murderous dictatorship.

Yet characters are still weak. Ye is the most emotionally realized, but we don't spend much time with her. Wang is our point of view, but that is mostly it. He has a wife and child, both unnamed, who seem to fall out of the story pretty easily.

I also wonder how would fare with some science fiction readers today. On the one hand, it is quite balanced in terms of gender representation, at least in the sciences. Yet gender roles are often quite traditional, with Ye yearning for children and men being men of action. Ye's crucial action is immediately followed by her learning of a pregnancy (276).

In sum, it's a bit better than I recalled. Now on to book two!

FIRST READING:
I was looking forward to this book ever since I first heard of it. I'm interested in global sf, and like the translator (Ken Liu)'s fiction. I was also intrigued by the widely varying reactions has received, from raves to boredom.

So, what do I make of it?

is a fascinating and strange work of science fiction. On one level it feels like a mid-to-late 20th-century sf adventure novel, with epic science, mysterious wars, cults, revenge, a cheerfully obnoxious cop, and interesting aliens. On another it's a work of hard sf, with many scientific problems solved, high- and low-tech computing architectures, principles applied, and clever solutions implemented.

On a third level it's about modern China, specifically the impact of China's . The novel is steeped in historical details, from the collapse of scientific research before revolutionary fervor to different political and military groups, to the .

And now I can't say anything more about the plot without spoilers. Here we go. It turns out that is really




As novel this is largely fascinating. The Chinese perspective is rich, from political details to the way a computer game integrates Chinese and Western historical traditions. The Trisolarian world is innovative. The dark view of humanity in this period is moving and thought-provoking.

Hard science details are striking. Cixin draws together a raft of ideas, from virtual reality multiplayer games to complex planetary mechanics to -dimensional topology, monofiliments, using planetary bodies as radio amplifiers, and more.

However, most characters are often thinly drawn. Professor Wang Miao is something of a point of view character, but we learn little about him. Only Ye Wenjie appears with some depth.

There are other strange or disappointing aspects. I'm not sure what to make of the claim, for instance, that GMOs will lead to ""ecological disasters"" (83). The appearance of villains who then become extra-bad feels a bit pulpy.

Yet I'm certainly engaged. I found myself thinking about the game and the revenge plot for a while after reading, and hope to dive into the sequel soon.

Finally, I'm reviewing a book I finished less than 4 days ago.

You know me, I intent to read at least one book from every country of the world.
I'm also a fan of science fiction (literature / film), and recently popular science books too.

So when I found out about this science fiction book written by a Chinese author (and since I haven't read a novel from China before), I decided to discover Chinese literature with a science fiction trilogy by Chinese (duh) novelist Liu Cixin.

In his Author's Postscript he describes exactly what fascinates me in science (fiction):
 p.427

And this is exactly what fascinates me too as a science, and science fiction fan.
Something that is far away in the past (Jurassic Era) or far away in space (Pillars of Creation)
or something that is very small and hard to imagine (proton, quark), fascinates me and leaves me awestruck.

If you blend ,  and  you have this book.
Well, not exactly but it has a few similarities with the above books: virtual reality world, contact with extraterrestrials, and a deadly threat to humanity.

The Three-Body problem is part of a trilogy called «Remembrance of Earth's Past». It is one of those books that if you give too much away it's easy to spoil many aspects of the story. And I went in blind with this book without knowing too much.

It is divided into three parts. The first takes place in the 1960's during the Cultural Revolution in China, a revolution that damaged China's economy and traditional culture by trying to purge capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society. The protagonist of this part sees her father beaten to death by revolutionaries.

Part two takes place in contemporary China (2000's) where a scientist explore a virtual reality world, an unstable, hostile world that has three suns.
The third part shows us that this virtual reality is an actual world and its inhabitants are coming to Earth in about 300 years.

But that's the story for the next books.

But of course the book is not the usual science fiction action filled story. It is actually hard science fiction with a lot of exposition to science (theory and history), to Chinese modern history, along with the author's imagination of this distant world with its three suns (Trisolaris).

George R. R. Martin said that this is: 

And since I mentioned George R. R. Martin; the people responsible for the adaptation of his books into a TV series (Benioff and Weiss) are planning to adapt this series too.

"What a silly book!

1. Wooden dialogue
2. Cardboard characters
3. Meandering narrative
4. Glaring plot hole

*No spoilers
___________
Introduction
I had high hopes, but I don't think that colored my disappointment any more darkly. I heard about this book from so many lists of ""Best first contact books ever written."" The first book I took on was ""Blindsight"" by Peter Watts. It blew my mind wide open. It was a powerful literary and conceptual experiment that I have read 3 times now.

Since ""The Three-Body Problem"" was also highly recommended, I grabbed it at the bookstore and read the first chapter. The compelling account of the Cultural Revolution was so stunning that I put it down and read, ""Red Scarf Girl"" by Ji-Li Jiang to get myself up to speed on the cultural context.

When I returned to chapter 2 of ""The Three-Body Problem,"" I was really shocked by the way the book continued. I was baffled by the Hugo Award and pull quotes from Barack Obama, The Wall Street Journal, George R.R. Martin, and NPR. None of the accolades made any sense to me.
_______________

1. Wooden Dialogue: Ken Liu came clean in the translator's note at the end of the book and admitted that he tended toward literal translation even though it highlights the wide gulf between American and Chinese thinking. The conversations in this book feel like the script for a badly dubbed kung-fu movie of the 60's. Most lines are delivered like Old Uncle Yi is wagging his finger at someone after too much wine and he is lecturing the youth on the old days. Here is a perfect example from page 63:
-----
Forcing his anger down, Wang said, ""The way you speak is not appropriate for a good police officer.""
""Who said I'm a good cop?""
""We don't know why these researchers killed themselves, but you shouldn't speak of them so contemptuously. Their minds have made irreplaceable contributions to humanity.""
-----
The dialogue had me laughing out loud a few times, and not because I was supposed to.
____________

2. Cardboard Characters
None of these characters are compelling or the least bit interesting. The main character, Wang, is simply a random scientist who gets in over his head. He just goes along with everything. He has a family, but seems to disappear from them for long bits of time without anyone seeming to notice.

Big Shi is interesting, but he is still a cliche.

Ye is SUPPOSED to be compelling, but her narrative just does not work. We see the trauma which drove her in the first chapter, but honestly, her actions afterward are inconsistent and not believable.
__________________

3. Meandering Narrative
This book can't focus on things which would make an interesting story. There are gaps in time and place which prevent the reader from being invested in any one line. The story seems to try being avant garde by switching narrative styles randomly. At one point a character is going to tell her story and it randomly switches from dialogue to a transcript of an interrogation. Yet within that interrogation, characters who aren't present interrupt the character to ask questions...I can't even explain it...it's just bad.
_________________

4. Glaring Plot Hole
So. No spoiler. There is a plot hole so incredibly glaring, that I just don't know what to make of it.
______________

Conclusion
The only engaging thing about this book was trying to figure out why the hell it got all these awards and accolades. It doesn't hold a candle to ""Blindsight"" and it should not be on any ""best of"" lists.

"Buku ini sesungguhnya punya bawaan yang sangat kelam. Diawali dengan persekusi di masa revolusi kebudayaan (saban kali membaca novel dengan latar setting ttg revbud aku merinding ngeri ih), di tengahnya penuh dengan acuan para ilmuwan yang bunuh diri, dan diakhiri dengan ramalan punahnya ras manusia. Apa sih yang bagus-bagusnya.

Tapi mungkin kengerian yang diam-diam menghampiri dan mengawasi dalam senyap inilah daya tarik novel Trisurya yang sesungguhnya. Tentu saja dengan tambahan fantasi ilmiah dan segala hal ttg astrofisika dan teknologi kuantum.

Jika ide dan alur ceritanya cukup bikin penasaran, aku merasa karakter-karakter utamanya terasa mengambang dan sangat dua dimensi. Selain Ye Wenjie yang cukup lengkap diceritakan, lainnya hanya tempelan, bahkan Prof. Wang yang jadi tokoh protagonis utama. Dibanding jadi Holmes di permainan misteri OBT, Wang Miao hanya jadi pengamat seperti Dr. Watson. Gak asyik. Padahal saat dia berperan dalam game Tiga Benda bersama ilmuwan-ilmuwan ternama dunia - dan berhasil memecahkannya - itu momen yang harusnya dibuat lebih meledak gitu. Karakter polisi Shi jauh lebih menarik, tapi porsinya lebih kecil. Shi Qiang ini mewakili pemikiran orang awam yang mampu berpikir out of the box, ia mempecundangi para ilmuwan dan petinggi militer yang terkungkung dalam aturan mereka yang sebenarnya tidak ada.


Senjakala manusia.

Edisi Indonesianya ini oke banget. Dari segi penerjemahan, meski aku tidak suka proses dobel translasi, tapi baik penerjemah bahasa Inggris (Ken Liu - one of my fav sff writer) maupun penerjemah bahasa Indonesia (Oni Suryaman - yg sdh gak asing lagi di jagad sff) mengerjakannya dengan sangat apik dan mulus. Enak sekali dibaca hingga berjam-jam tanpa rasa bosan atau berat. Covernya... ohemji covernya... aku suka sekali. Dari skala 1 - 10, kukasih skor 11 deh. Dari warnanya yg merah terang, hingga karakter 三体 yang memdominasi tengah ruang. Apalagi jika diperhatikan, tiga bulatan emas yang melayang itu adalah tri surya dan lintasannya yang chaotic. Huuuaahh... keren ih.

Yang aku kurang suka itu sinopsisnya di cover belakang. Jika sudah kepegang inti cerita, sinopsis paragraf pertamanya itu langsung jadi spoiler ttg apa yg terjadi, dan itu mengurangi setengah misterinya menurutku (meski di akhir-akhir masih banyak twist and turn-nya sih). #eh

Jadi KPG, kira2 kapan sequel kedua dan ketiganya bakal terbit? Ku penasaran.

"This book is a uniquely flavored but undercooked sample of my favorite style of dish: mind-bending science fiction. This review contains mild spoilers about technology in the book that reveal no plot details.

If the translation had rendered the dialogue more natural in English, if the narrative were more consistent, if the characters were better developed, and if the concept of the multi-dimensional constructions within “sub-baryonic” matter during the development of the critically-important-to-the-plot Sophons were not so problematic (the many dimensions are not given even a cursory explanation in the book, and I see issues with how a speck of “sub-baryonic-sized” instruments smaller than any light wavelength would be able to perceive, record, and transmit information gathered exclusively by light, and to make that light travel faster than light, to boot [I might also add that if the final pre-parenthetical phrase seemed a bit wordy, you are warned that this book contains myriad such phrases]), “The Three Body Problem” could very well have been an awe-inspiring read for me.

The three-body game itself is a genius way to expose the humans in the story and the humans reading the story to the plight of those who live in such a unique gravitational system. I wish I could play more games like it! The Stable Eras remind me of wandering through the Playstation game “Journey,” but attempting to understand the cycle of the celestial bodies while living at risk of extreme heat or cold at any moment would add another layer of intrigue to the game.

The Chinese literary mindset tends to deal more with society than the individual - this seems particularly true during the beginning time period of the novel - but this book clearly tries to tell its tale through the journeys of two of its characters. Neither of those two, however, are literarily developed or unique characters. They fill a perfunctory void. I’ll agree with many reviewers here that the main policeman in the novel is certainly the best character of them all, but his role is secondary. I wish the story had somehow been told exclusively through his eyes. The book would have been much more fun that way!

Compared to the author, I am merely a neophyte when it comes to physics, so if anyone up to speed on current string theory models can offer clarification about how the hypothesized Sophons could possibly send video information, that would be helpful. I also wonder how, if they are only able to travel around the earth approximately 8 times per second, they would still be able to meddle with enough people simultaneously to accomplish their task. Perhaps my doubts are ill-founded, and I am but a bug.

"Tenía muchas expectativas puestas en este libro, y no me defraudó. Es una lectura compleja con una trama intrigante, sin que por ello se torne lenta o confusa. La historia consta de tres partes, así que voy a dar una breve descripción por cada una de ellas.
❦
Primera Parte, Primavera Silenciosa: el autor nos da un breve repaso histórico de la sangrienta Revolución Cultural China, desde el punto de vista de Ye Wenjie, una joven Astrofísica que pierde a su padre a manos de los guardias rojos, y es enviada al Cuerpo de Producción y Construcción de Mongolia Interior para ser reformada. Desde allí hallará su camino hasta la ultrasecreta base militar Costa Roja en el año 1969, en donde se practicaban misteriosos experimentos con una gigantesca antena parabólica.
❦
Segunda parte, Tres Cuerpos: Más de cuarenta años más tarde, la historia continúa desde el punto de vista del investigador científico Wang Miao, experto en nanomateriales. Este es arrastrado por el ejército a una reunión en un lugar al que llaman Centro de Comandancia de Batalla, donde se encuentra con científicos y militares de varios países y lo ponen al tanto de la inusual muerte de un gran número de Físicos en todo el mundo, y de una inminente “guerra”, aunque contra quienes, nadie lo informa.
Una series de sucesos perturbadores comenzarán a ocurrirle a Wang, por lo que busca la ayuda de una organización llamada Fronteras de la Ciencia. Allí se entera por casualidad de la existencia de un juego de realidad virtual llamado Tres Cuerpos, en el que poco a poco se sumergirá.
❦
Tercera parte, El Ocaso de la Humanidad: Tres Cuerpos resulta ser mucho más que un juego. Por medio de este, Wang, junto a otras personas, se entera de la existencia de una civilización extraterrestre en un planeta al que llaman Trisolaris. El juego nos irá relatando la terrible historia de esta civilización, azotada por desgracias y desolaciones, por medio de historias relatadas por importantes figuras de nuestra propia historia (científicos, filósofos, matemáticos, reyes, etc), de cómo se enteran de la existencia de nuestro planeta, y de las consecuencias que esto significará, tanto para los Trisolarianos como para la humanidad.
El final, si bien estuvo bien desarrollado y ejecutado, fue un poco lineal. Esperaba algo un poco más emocionante, alguna revelación más impactante. De todas formas esto es una trilogía, y el autor no puede usar todas sus cartas en la primer entrega, eso lo entiendo. Ciertamente logró engancharme, y ahora necesito leer la segunda entrega cuanto antes para saber que va a suceder.

"I wanted to like this book a lot more than I actually did, but there was still a lot of interesting and worthwhile stuff to be found.

Spoiler-Free Review:
The Three-Body Problem is more a medium to deliver ideas than an actual story. Your toleration for that (or lack thereof) is going probably going to determine in large part how you feel about this book. The ideas are fascinating, and there were a hand-full of scenes - particularly one near the end - that were weird and beautiful and imaginative, sci-fi at its best. But I honestly probably would have enjoyed them more if they were simply written up as a kind of what-if scenario. It would have allowed Liu Cixin to convey his genuine enthusiasm and love for big ideas and big spaces without bogging things down in characters that remain really, really flat and whose motivations are often unconvincing. With the exception of Da Shi, who valiantly tries and fails to bring to life the other characters around him, the characters are little more than exposition machines.

There's still a lot of fun stuff here, and the ideas were good enough that I'll at least consider reading the next two entries in the series. I liked reading a sci-fi novel that was grounded in the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath, which resulted in a slightly different emphasis in the book's themes. And I liked the idea that

"Hay 30 páginas en este libro, el capítulo llamado Sofón, que me recuerdan lo mejor de lo poco que había leído de Cixin Liu en relato/novela corta. Ideas especulativas fluyendo sin rubor prendiendo el relato con la chispa de esa imaginación sin complejos que, hasta ese momento, ha andado un tanto escasa. Y El problema de los tres cuerpos paga un poco el pato por esa contención en lo que parece ser el punto fuerte de su autor. Aunque en cierta forma, tal y como está planteada, tiene hasta sentido. Antes de desmelenarse es necesario mostrar el desapego de un personaje, Ye Wenjie, hacia su país y todo el género humano para entender por qué hace lo que hace. Y resulta fundamental hablar sobre las catástrofes ecológicas para comprender la tanatomanía de un puñado de personas dispuestas a borrar del mapa a la humanidad. Crear algo de misterio detrás de la ola de suicidios de científicos punteros, las visiones que atormentan a uno de los personajes, el enigmático juego en red en un paisaje tan alienígena... Sin embargo el desarrollo es tan lineal, con personajes tan unidimensionales, con diálogos tan acartonados, con ladrillos informativos tan rutinarios que casi me ha hecho añorar los melodramas baratos de Robert J. Sawyer (después recuerdo más cosas y se me pasa un poco XD). Es como Los propios dioses pero bastante peor contado.

Donde me ha sorprendido El problema de los tres cuerpos es en la aparente convicción de que el universo es un lugar cognoscible donde la vida inteligente bulle y es capaz de entablar contacto sin complicaciones. Los mensajes se descifran y comprenden de manera instantánea, las dinámicas sociales son equivalentes, la dialéctica conquista o sé sometido parece una constante universal... Solarianos y humanos a ratos parecen dos bandas de Inglewood enfrentadas porque la primera quisiera quedarse con todo el pastel. La otredad queda por el momento arrinconada al ámbito los conocimientos superiores de los primeros, a la espera de ver qué pasa en los próximos libros.

"you know when you're recommending a book to others before you've technically reached the last page that the book is very, very good.

(you also know a book is good when it almost makes you regret dropping physics after high school. even my mother couldn't manage to make me regret that decision.)

translated from the original chinese, is hard science fiction written in a way that actually makes sense to the layman, if of course you read certain paragraphs twice. it follows two separate timelines: that of ye wenjie in the late 1960s, who watched her father's murder at the hands of the red guard before finding herself inside a very interesting facility at Radar Peak; and that of wang miao over forty years later, a nanomaterials researcher who is only just discovering that there is far more to the people around him than it seems.

the plot is complex, with enough twists to keep the reader engaged. i sped through a good two-thirds of the book in one go because i couldn't put it down: every chapter's ending had me wondering what would happen next. i will admit that a few characters were a bit two-dimensional, existing more to move the plot forward than to actually contribute any personality of their own, but those who did have character were very well written.

spattered throughout the book are certain translator's notes that are regular enough to help international readers understand certain translated phrases which only make sense in context, whilst simultaneously being sparse enough that they don't detract from the reading itself. they were actually very useful: ken liu mentions to readers that he tried his best to translate to english without americanising the original content, and i think those notes did their job well.

one thing i will say to people who might want to read this book: don't read the summary given here on goodreads. it ruins the experience.

Bueno a ver cómo hago reseña de este libro sin fangirlear demasiado. Tenía las expectativas altas, porque la gente no hacía más que alabar este libro. Y tenían razón: es alucinante.

No quiero contar nada de la trama, porque es espectacular ir descubriendo los entresijos que nos presenta Cixin Liu. Diré que el libro nos enseña una China enfocada desde su Revolución Cultural, momento en el cual tuvo lugar un acontecimiento fundamental para la humanidad, que va a revelarse años después, todo aderezado con una ciencia explicada de forma magistral.

Los personajes no son el punto fuerte de este libro, sin embargo hay uno que me ha gustado por encima de los demás: Da Shi. Este policía irreverente de vuelta de todo, sin idea alguna sobre ciencia, es capaz de devolver a sus cabales a los científicos que están a su alrededor. Tiene un par de momentos muy reveladores, y espero que en los siguientes libros de la saga siga dando mucho juego.

Y hablando de juegos, mención especial a la forma tan magnífica del autor de incluir el problema de los tres cuerpos en un videojuego.

No es que sea un libro trepidante, pero te mantiene pegado a sus páginas porque quieres saber más cosas y revelar el misterio, y cuando por fin se revela, no pierde ritmo, si no que te hace querer más y más. Exceptuando un capítulo en el que casi me estalla la cabeza entre las dimensiones, los protones y los microcosmos (y que he tenido que leer un par de veces para enterarme bien), el resto de capítulos es un no parar.

Por último, agradecer al traductor (Javier Altayó), porque ha sido una delicia leerlo.

"Full of ideas, but not all of them land. It was so interesting to see science fiction put through a Chinese strainer, like all these ideas were almost every sci-fi book I have ever read but twisted in just such a way that they were totally new. We don’t get to see blockbuster movies where the aliens land in Beijing or the meteor hits in the South China Sea. Our media is Western centric. And I mean, I get it, you want your reader to connect to the story and the characters, and the best way to do that is to write someone they can understand. But when you have been reading genre for decades, it is to see it from another point of view.

I was reminded of the brief Superman run, , where Superman crash lands in the Soviet Union instead of Kansas. Interesting premise – but still written by Americans. The views of the Soviet Union are from Americans looking at the Soviet Union. There is those writers did it justice like someone who grew up there could have.

I want to know more about how this was published. I can only find articles about its reception in the West. I’m a little shocked it was published in China and was so popular. If the Chinese government purports Tiananman Square didn’t happen, how were all these gruesome details of the Cultural Revolution allowed to be talked about?

This is very much a hard sci-fi, so if you’re looking for character development, you’ll have to look elsewhere. If you want your brain to light up with “what if?” scenarios, this might be the book for you.

Autor ale umí ""tu vědu"" napsat, což je u mě jeden z hlavních plusů knihy. Třeba takové rozepsání problematiky tří těles do formy počítačové hry je zajímavý nápad a především to funguje, takhle to pochopí i takový věcí nepolíbený čtenář jako já. A lidský počítač jsem si vyloženě užila :-)

Jestliže ta ""vědecká"" rovina knížky funguje skvěle, tak trochu horší už to má autor s koherentností příběhu, psychologií postav atd. - tam to drhne, a občas jako že i hodně, ale ve finále mi to překvapivě vadilo míň než jsem čekala. Řada nakousnutých motivů není v knize nijak ukončená, nevím, zda se to dořeší později nebo to prostě vyšumělo, což by byla škoda, ale uvidíme.

Téma Kulturní revoluce je určitě zajímavé, ale reálně nemá na děj skoro žádný vliv a je to pouze takový přívažek a slabší část knihy - což je škoda. Stejně tak i rovina ""zrady"" lidstva a jejich pohnutek je na vedlejší koleji.

Zajímavá kniha, která se čte velmi dobře a už se těším na další dva díly. Váhala jsem mezi 3 a 4, ale nakonec jsem se přiklonila k tomu vyššímu hodnocení, protože jsem si to jednoduše užila.

Y la verdad, no me parecían unos ladrillos super cruciales para el devenir de la trama que al fin y al cabo es una SPOILER invasión extraterreste.
El colmo es cuando Cixin nos dice en el epilogo que las mejores historias del mundo no las han creado novelistas sino científicos. Ahí ya me expliqué un poco todo lo demás. Y eso que el tipo no escribe mal, pero es como el típico profesor sobrao que sigue explicando aunque la mitad de la clase no se ha enterado de la misa la mitad.
Eso sí, tiene conceptos super chulos como lo de la computadora humana o los protones en 3d. La historia tiene buena pinta así que la continuaré, espero no tener que empollar para entenderla x)

#Ακολουθεί το αρχικό ποστ.#

Μερικές πολύ έξυπνες ιδέες συνδυάζονται με το πλούσιο επιστημονικό υπόβαθρο του συγγραφέα για να μας δώσουν ένα βιβλίο που πολλές φορές αγγίζει τα όρια του συναρπαστικού.

Δεν είναι άψογο το storytelling, πολλές φορές περιγράφονται σκηνικά που φαντάζουν αλλόκοτα και μη αληθοφανή, ενώ οι (ιδιόρρυθμοι) χαρακτήρες είναι απλά εκεί για να σπρώξουν την πλοκή, έχοντας κίνητρα οριακά αδύναμα, κι ας έχει προσπαθήσει με κάποιες προοικονομίες ο δημιουργός να δικαιολογήσει τη συμπεριφορά τους.

Όμως, κι εδώ είναι ένα μεγάλο όμως, η πλούσια φαντασία του συγγραφέα, η πρωτοτυπία στην προσέγγιση ενός κοινότυπου θέματος ΕΦ, η επιστημονική ανάλυση, και η ευφυής εκμετάλλευση του ενστίκτου της περιέργειας είναι στοιχεία που με έκαναν να ξεπεράσω όλα τα προβλήματα και να απολαύσω το βιβλίο.

Υγ: Με τον Liu Cixin μοιραζόμαστε το ίδιο πάθος για την επιστήμη της φυσικής. Όμως νομίζω πως κάπου πρέπει να χαλιναγωγήσει αυτό το πάθος. Ειδικά στο τέλος του βιβλίου ήταν χείμαρρος σε θεωρίες που ξεφευγαν από τα πλαίσια της έξυπνης διαχείρισης τους, σε σημείο που ένιωσα πως ακροβατουσε επικίνδυνα στο χείλος ενός γκρεμού που ονομάζεται φαντασιοπληξία.

"Calificación final: 5/5

Excelente novela de ciencia ficción. En definitiva Cixin Liu es a mi parecer un nuevo Isaac Asimov o Arthur C. Clarke del género.
“El problema de los tres cuerpos” es la primera entrega de una trilogía que ya anhelo continuar y que pone en la balanza moral y ética de quien la lee, la disyuntiva de si sería realmente bueno que una civilización extraterrestre nos descubriera y quisiera visitar.
Además Cixin nos presenta como la raza humana sigue siendo el peor enemigo de sí misma, y que puede incluso aniquilarse sin ayuda externa.
En resumen, y porque sería bueno no saber mucho de la trama para disfrutarla mejor, el libro nos cuenta de cómo la tierra y sus habitantes tienen una condena que surtirá efecto dentro de 4 siglos, cuando una flota del planeta Trisolaris decida conquistarnos y colonizarnos.
Sin embargo esto no sucedió sólo porque si, sino qué hay gente de la tierra que tiene mucho de culpa de que esto suceda, y están decididos que lo mejor que le puede ocurrir a todos es ser destruidos, así que serán dos fuerzas las que se contrapondrán para cumplir su cometido: los que quieren la aniquilación humana por los extraterrestres y los que intentarán a toda costa evitarla.
Increíble historia. Si te gusta la ciencia ficción con muchas referencias científicas del tipo astrofísico y matemático pero bien explicadas y relativamente fáciles de entender, este libro te encantará. Yo ya quiero ir por el segundo.

"One of the most interesting science fiction novels I've read in a long, long time. It's very hard SF in that there are long passages that are mostly explanations on how certain aspects of theoretical physics work, so if you're not interested in physics, or if physics doesn't appeal to you in any way, then look elsewhere.

This is a novel of ideas, much like Asimov's novels. There are characters, and I enjoyed them, they're more shells and shades than they are fully developed people. The main character, for example, has a family, but only interacts with them for about five pages of the 400 pages. In fact, most of the interactions happen in virtual reality, which is pretty cool, but even most of these interactions are highly theoretical or philosophical.

Some of my favorite moments, though, are when he just puts two people together and they talk about things unrelated to the plot. It's a rare occurrence, but it shows he can create living, breathing people.

The style and content make it extremely surprising that it's such an enormous bestseller in China [over 400,000 copies!], but it makes me interested in Chinese science fiction in a way I never thought I'd be. This is clearly a very different literary tradition with very different expectation.

I have much more to say, which will probably be in a review to come.

"“I started the fire, but I couldn’t control how it burnt.”


This was certainly the most unique book I have read all year.

I kind of neglected science fiction for a while, although I never stopped loving this genre. Upon reading this incredible novel I’m pretty sure that I will do my best to read even more SF.

For me the first half consisted of many different stories that all matched up in the end. But also, it was not the outline that has captivated me, but the smallest of events; the ideas.

A few times I had my jaw dropped at certain thoughts. What SF as in the meaning of ‘shooting’ and ‘farming’ represents. How the more I read the more sense the cover made. How the dimensions and our knowledge was described. How one person with only three seconds could change everything.

And how science could be killed.

I jumped into this story without knowing anything beforehand, and now I really can’t wait to find out more.

"Very short review.

I am going to find this book hard to review. It was a mixed bag for me. A liked the concept, the Chinese theme, the narration, the characters and pretty much most of it, but the tech side at times just threw my concentration level out of the window.

For the first half of the book, you sit there wondering what you have gotten yourself into, it isn't clear what you are reading genre wise. Then you are feed a little piece at a time and you beginning to see the bigger picture. The introduction of a computer game changes the story and immerses you into something new and...well.... out there.

Overall, I did enjoy it, it was different and interesting. If you can phase out during the high tech parts, which is probably easier reading than listening and enjoy the story for what it is, then I think you won't be disappointed.

"I went looking for this book to buy it to read for my book club, since the library had too many holds to get it to me in time. I got to our big local box-bookstore, and was dismayed to find that they didn't appear to have it. I checked the store computer, which said there were four copies. I eventually found it shelved in the fantasy sections, which...no. Just no. This is not one of those genre-straddling books. It's pretty firmly in the SF camp.

"The emphasis is so much more on the first word, in this stellar piece of _science fiction_ than usual in the genre. I was lucky to grow up surrounded by discussions of both the mundane and more abstract concepts in math and physics, and I wish this book was around already then to be discussed, too...

The translation from Chinese is amazing, still easy to read, but somehow carrying a subtle hint of coming from a non-English culture, from dialogues to metaphors, refreshingly unusual for the genre. The context easing through isolationist Cultural Revolution years to modern day globalist international collaboration, on the way to events in distant galaxies adds a completely new dimension (ha!) to the storyline, too.

Mental note: when so many different people recommend you a book over time (thanks!), add it to the top, not the bottom of the list next time. On to book #2.

"One of the most overrated books in existence. It’s a difficult to follow mix of hard science and politics. Even the video game component is dull and confusing. Early on there are character and time switches that throw readers off the story. And there are implausible events throughout, such as countdown numbers magically appearing on non-digital pictures. Anyway, the theme is that obstructing scientific progress is the best way to hurt human society: “To effectively contain a civilization’s development and disarm it across such a long span of time, there is only one way: kill its science” (p. 360).

"An intriguing and very science filled novel here from Liu Cixin, I think perhaps it was a LITTLE heavy on the scientific idea's and a little less heavy on actual story - but it was very compelling especially in parts and a very different read for me.

I enjoyed it without LOVING it, and I have the other 2 books in the trilogy to come, which I will definitely be reading but I'll probably let this one settle a bit first before diving in.

I think if you like intellectual science fiction with a strong speculative edge then this one will be for you. But it does take some patience. Worth it in the end!

Me parece curioso que los personajes solo están de fondo, el verdadero protagonista es el contacto entre las dos civilizaciones, y por lo menos en la historia de la humanidad ese tipo de contactos nunca salen bien, así que estoy ansiando saber qué va a pasar.

"This book was recommended to me by a coworker who admired the author's creativity. I think she's crazy. This book was a mess - a boring, exposition-heavy, humorless, cheerless mess. I'm not even sure you could call it a novel since it was just a platform for the author to expound on his ideas about science and philosophy. To be a novel, don't you need characters with lives, needs, and desires? It's no more a novel than the game inside of this mess of a book was a game. It's just a huge pile of... exposition.

"DNF. No review. This one is way beyond my comprehension.

I am currently watching the Netflix series. Let's hope they have dumbed the theoretical science down enough that I can understand it. With that hope, I am giving it another try. It has always bothered me that I was not intelligent enough to get anywhere with this. The first time I read it, here were glimpses of some really exciting stuff in it, but I kept losing the connection.

So,here we go again.

"3.5 Stars - Great book

I had a hard time rating this book. I don’t think it deserves less than 3 stars, but I keep going back and forth on whether it deserves more. Right now I am partially comfortable giving it 3.5 - that may change.

The writing is beautiful and engaging. I have to give credit to the author, of course, but to the translator too. While I read I felt like I was there. I could imagine the surroundings. Take for instance this sentence:

That sort of descriptive writing juxtaposed the scientific writing and creates a nice balance. It keeps the reader from getting bored or giving up, at least it did for me.

I know this is science-fiction, but I was surprised at all of the technical information and actual science. Sci-fi as a genre is still new to me and something I’m not completely comfortable with. Up until this book, the sci-fi I read didn’t have a lot of actual science in it and if it did, it was basic stuff you learn in high school that the author took and added their fiction to it (not knocking it, just noting it). There is a lot but at times it was a little overwhelming. However, the author explained it all very well. I also appreciated the footnotes that explained concepts and people in science, the Cultural Revolution, and Chinese cultural. It saved my reading time from being interrupted with me googling things I didn’t understand.

Let me share with you my scientific ignorance. The book’s title is an actual scientific concept. In physics and classical mechanics (according to ) is, and I am watering this down, taking data of 3 bodies and determining their movements. Fascinating and at it’s basic level I sort of understand, but the more you dive into it the less and less I understand.

The book’s pace is a mystery too. Slow isn’t the right word, but it’s the best I can think of. Every part of this book is so meticulous and sophisticated that I think a lot of it went over my head. When I use the word slow, you must understand I don’t mean that the plot is slow moving. I think it’s more organic and flows naturally. There are tense and ‘fast moving’ parts and then there are sections that are in a lab or research facility that require more concentration and detail. I guess the best way I can think of to describe what I’m trying to get across, is that the book has a distinctive rhythm and I’ve never read anything like it.

Do I recommend this one? I think I do but it’s not for everyone.

"Μου άφησε πολλές σκέψεις αυτό το βιβλίο. Σίγουρα είχε πολύ διαφορετικά μεταξύ τους και ενδιαφέροντα κομμάτια. Σίγουρα είχε πολλά να πει, σε πολιτικό, επιστημονικό και περιβαλλοντικό επίπεδο. Λογοτεχνικά δε μου έκατσε και πολύ καλά. Προφανώς θα υπάρξουν σπόιλερς! Αλλά ας εξηγηθώ:

Το πρώτο μέρος του βιβλίου, με το εξαίσια δοσμένο ιστορικό πλαίσιο, με έβαλε για τα καλά στην ιστορία. Ήταν πολύ αόριστος ο δεσμός με το υπόλοιπο βιβλίο, αλλά καταλαβαίνει κανείς ότι πρόκειται για χτίσιμο μυστηρίου και ότι το ενδιάμεσο θα μας απασχολήσει αργότερα.

Το χρονικό παρόν της ιστορίας ενδιαφέρον. Αυτόχειρες επιστήμονες, η επιστήμη της φυσικής δε βγάζει νόημα (!!!) κι ένα παράξενο παιχνίδι με τόσο βάθος, που πρόκειται να απασχολήσει μόνο διανοούμενους. Ακόμα και σε αυτό το σημείο, τα στοιχεία είναι πολύ έξυπνα δοσμένα και προσεκτικά τυχαία για την ώρα. Δεν πιστεύω ότι κάποιος αναγνώστης θα έχει καταλάβει πολλά μέχρι εδώ. Διαβάζει, μελετά, αναμένει.

Οι αποκαλύψεις για το παρελθόν της Γιέ Γουεντζί και τις εδώ και χρόνια ειλημμένες αποφάσεις συσχετίζουν το ηθικό, το περιβαλλοντικό και το επιστημονικό κομμάτι με την κίνηση που αλλάζει την ανθρώπινη ιστορία.

Κι εδώ έρχεται το πρώτο αγαπημένο μου σημείο: η ανάγκη να δούμε τα πράγματα σφαιρικά, μη ανθρωποκεντρικά, ώστε να κατανοήσουμε την απόφασή της. Η έννοια ""Το πρόβλημα των τριών σωμάτων"" μου ταιριάζει κι εδώ:
1) Οι οπαδοί της έλευσης
2) Οι οπαδοί της εξιλέωσης
3) Οι επιζώντες

Τρεις διαφορετικοί τρόποι να κατανοήσει, να ερμηνεύσει και να αντιδράσει η ανθρωπότητα απέναντι στην επικείμενη εισβολή των Τρισήλιων, οι οποίοι μάλιστα θα έχουν φτάσει στη Γη 450 χρόνια μετά. Και προκαλεί δέος η προσοχή με την οποία οι δύο πλευρές προσεγγίζουν αυτό το μέλλον και τι μέτρα παίρνουν.

Το τελευταίο μέρος του βιβλίου, το πιο sci fi από όλα, θεωρώ πως ήταν υπερανεπτυγμένο, σε βαθμό που ναι μεν εξηγούσε τα πάντα, αλλά δεν είχε και πολλή βάση. Η κοσμοπλασία μου φάνηκε τρομερά ελλιπής και δεν ξέρω αν αυτό είναι ηθελημένο, μιας και είναι το πρώτο μέρος τριλογίας.

Η όλη φάση με το σοφόνιο, όσο ενδιαφέρουσα κι αν ήταν, έκανε πολλά άλματα λογικής. Αλλά φυσικά, για επιστημονική φαντασία μιλάμε, όχι για επιστήμη. Και οτιδήποτε έχει να κάνει με ανώτερους πολιτισμούς, άλλες διαστάσεις και διαστρικά ταξίδια μου κεντρίζει το ενδιαφέρον, δηλώνω πως συνολικά με τράβηξε το όλο ζήτημα, σε βαθμό που το σκέφτομαι συνεχώς από την ώρα που ολοκλήρωσα το βιβλίο.

Στο λογοτεχνικό κομμάτι, όπως προείπα είδα κάποια ζητήματα που δε μου άρεσαν. Χαρακτήρες που δρούσαν κι αντιδρούσαν κάπως ανέκφραστα, άλλοτε προσπερνώντας αντιδράσεις κι άλλοτε παραδινόμενοι σε ατέλειωτους μονολόγους, που δε με βοήθησαν να δεθώ με κάποιον από αυτούς (πέρα από τον Ντα Σι, ο οποίος έκανε και όλους τους άλλους πιο ανθρώπινους λειτουργώντας σαν ντόμινο). Πολλά ονόματα ήταν δοσμένα με δύο ή τρεις τρόπους, κάτι που θα μπορούσε να προκαλεί σύγχυση αλλά εντάξει, τα καταφέραμε.

Συνολικά, σίγουρα πρόκειται για μεγάλη δουλειά, για φαντασία με όραμα και με ένα μυστήριο που αποκαλύπτεται σταδιακά, κάνοντας τα πάντα να βγάζουν νόημα στο τέλος. Οπότε φυσικά προτείνεται.

"Those who have followed me over the past several years might raise their eyebrows when they see me reviewing a science fiction novel, and that would be warranted given that
I don't read it all that often anymore.
But science fiction used to be my jam. I had re-discovered reading for pleasure a few years after high school and once that happened, I devoured science fiction through the 80s and 90s. Arthur C. Clarke's 2001 and the next few in the series, Rendezvous with Rama, John Varley's Titan trilogy. Dan Simmons' Hyperion. Wow. These had captured my imagination like nothing else.

Unfortunately for my tastes, science fiction became Speculative Fiction, which lectured the reader on the perils of abusing our planet. That's all well and good if that's your bag. Me? I don't need lectures in my pleasure reading. I know what's up. Reading is my escape. Even at the age I've gotten to I'm still looking for that sense of wonder from this genre. I always keep an eye on releases and lists, but nothing seems to entice me. It seems to have become a genre of self-importance.
But this one kept popping up. And when I replied to the New York Public Library's tweet offering recommendations based on any title with 2001: A Space Odyssey, The One-Body Problem was the answer.

It took me three or four tries to settle into this one. It has a slow start to it, referring to a lot of Chinese history, but I was hit with strong focus for some reason, and the book managed to take hold. I loved a lot of the ideas in this story, and it's a great one. Despite the occasional clunkiness of writing, which is normally something I have zero patience for, I stuck with it through the end. This ended up being quite a feat particularly through the third-last chapter, the longest in the book, which dealt with dimensions, photons and sophons that took me three nights to plow through. There is a lot of heavy science throughout this, but I admire the writer/translator's ability to break this down to a layman's level using clever and simple analogies. Except for that one chapter. That was heavy, but I did have an adequate understanding regardless.
One peeve I do have, though, is the use of many characters with similar names. This is needlessly confusing.

I'm glad I read it, but I don't think I will continue. I didn't particularly enjoy the prose, which could be attributed to translation, enough to get excited about book two.
Having said that, I did get a little bit of that wonder back for a little while, so thanks to the author for that. I may watch the TV series because it is a dynamite story that I'd like to see unfold.

"¿Quién no conoce esta aclamada trilogía?

Tras tres intensos meses de lectura de esta saga monumental, estoy lista para compartir una reseña general que, espero, transmita la magnitud de esta obra maestra de Liu Cixin y anime a más lectores a sumergirse en su universo fascinante y complejo.

Una obra maestra de la ciencia ficción contemporánea que desafía los límites de la imaginación y la ciencia. Desde su inicio con “El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos”, pasando por “El Bosque Oscuro” y culminando con “El Fin de la Muerte”, Liu Cixin nos transporta a un universo donde la física, la filosofía y la ética se entrelazan en una narrativa épica.

La saga comienza con la Revolución Cultural china y se expande hasta alcanzar las estrellas. Liu Cixin, con una habilidad narrativa excepcional, logra hacer accesible la ciencia avanzada sin sacrificar la complejidad de los conceptos explorados. La trama se desenvuelve con una crítica social aguda, presentando ciclos que se repiten y decisiones con profundas implicaciones, invitando al lector a una reflexión constante.

Los personajes son el corazón de esta historia. Desde Ye Wenjie hasta Cheng Xin, cada uno aporta una perspectiva única. Luo Ji, como el “hechicero” de la humanidad, ofrece una visión intrigante sobre la supervivencia a largo plazo. Estos personajes y muchos otros se entrelazan en una danza de destinos que refleja la complejidad de nuestras propias vidas.

Cada libro de la trilogía incrementa la apuesta, intensificando la intriga y expandiendo el alcance de la historia a escalas cósmicas. La evolución de los personajes y las civilizaciones que Liu Cixin describe es tan detallada y plausible que uno no puede evitar preguntarse sobre el verdadero lugar de la humanidad en el cosmos.

Realizar una lectura conjunta de las tres novelas fue una experiencia enriquecedora. Compartir impresiones y debatir teorías con mis compañeras añadió una dimensión adicional a la lectura. Las discusiones sobre los dilemas éticos y los giros argumentales nos permitieron apreciar aún más la profundidad y complejidad de la obra. Esta trilogía es una invitación a soñar, a cuestionar y, sobre todo, a disfrutar de una historia que se queda con el lector mucho después de haber cerrado el libro.

"«Es el ocaso de la humanidad. Y el mío también»

No esperaba engancharme tanto a este libro pero me lo he leído en tres días. Aunque es pura ciencia ficción tiene también una mezcla entre misterio, policíaco, videojuego... No es lo que me esperaba pero me ha sorprendido mucho para bien.

Tampoco me esperaba que este libro fuese a ser una introducción a una invasión extraterrestre que no llega a producirse aún. Que toda su trama sea cómo llega la humanidad a contactar con ellos y cómo empiezan a hacerse a la idea de que existen otras civilizaciones en el espacio y lo que les supone para ellos. Pensé que esto iba a parecerme un tostón pero ha sido al revés, me ha encantado lo bien que retrata la locura que es todo, aún cuando el conocimiento está limitado a solo ciertas esferas de la sociedad. Tengo muchas ganas de ver en el siguiente libro cómo ha reaccionado la gente normal a algo así.

Y los personajes me han parecido muy bien escritos. Ye Wenjie es una pasada desde principio a fin, y Da Shi da ese pequeño toque de comic relief que hace falta dentro de toda la seriedad.

Tengo que admitir que si no le doy 5 estrellas es porque la física/matemáticas que contiene y las explicaciones científicas en algunas partes se me han hecho difíciles de seguir, pero a la vez están muy muy bien planteadas, tanto que te preguntas cuáles de esas teorías pueden ser reales y cuales no

Eso sí, no lo recomiendo para alguien a quien no le guste leer páginas y páginas enteras de elucubraciones sobre fenómenos de la física

"And on this side, we have a story about a babe that ✨volunteered THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE as tribute for colonization✨...and friends.

I only have praise for Cixin Liu. He handled the sociological elements with grace and made the scientific ones fun. This story is relevant today as a criticism of colonialism, morality, and ethicality. I was locked in on the real events referenced, real people featured, and actual science research. The footnotes, reports, and interviews were especially enjoyable; if you told me that Mr. Liu wasn't a scientist, I wouldn't believe you. 😊

Being a full-time tech bro, I was intrigued by Cixin's take on VR and the 3body gaming website. Yes, I checked if it exists...it doesn't 🥲 Those were my favorite parts of the book. The creativity 🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽

I wish the effects of colonization were weighed and discussed more. We covered the fact that it's a crazy thing to do and it shouldn't be done, but I wanted to know his reasoning and perspective and maybe get an analysis...?? Living in a country still recovering, as a child of the first generation born free, it isn't vibes and inshallah reversing the damage and moving forward. The naivety and audacity these people have come from privilege, which should be clarified.

I have beef with Ms. Morally High Ground, Mr. ✨I'm not like other girls because I care for birds more than people, currently undergoing oppression bc I'm so misunderstood✨, and the Trisolarians. Can you leave Africa out of this?? Yall really said, We're tired. 🤣 You fuck around and find out by your ones.

I thought that this being translated from Chinese would be difficult to understand but it was simple to get through. I also listened to the audiobook while reading bc Chinese pronunciation is so different from English or German; I was having a hard time remembering how to say names 😅.

Waiting for my brother to finish this so we can pick up the next one soon 😊

"4.5/5
""Highly Thrilling and unique""

This one really hits it out of the park in the sci-fi genre. Possibly one of the most unique, and undoubtedly well written take on the usual ""alien invasion"" sci-fi trope. Of course the invasion hasn't yet come to fruition, but the build up is thoroughly exhilarating. The best part of this book is how it follows a very mixed format of writing style, I won't be able to elaborate on that properly, it's best to read and find out. Even though it doesn't have a strong focus on character build-up, it surely doesn't need to. I didn't have any strong feelings for any characters throughout the book, and that's one of the reasons why my rating is not a complete 5 stars, but I also understand why it doesn't really matter for this particular plot. There's a hell lot of science stuff, a lot of it that really confused me, but towards the end you do understand everything that's going on, and I guess that's what matters. Overall, I'm super excited for what's to come, as I've heard a lot about how the further books are much more fantastic.

I didn't mention anything about the actual plot intentionally, because I feel it's best to read it for yourself, and as I said, it's a unique take on ""alien invasion"" and I feel that's more than enough to pick this one up!!

Happy Reading!!

Γιατί 8.5? Γιατί είναι ένα πολύ καλό βιβλίο επιστημονικής φαντασίας που μου θυμίζει πολύ έντονα την ταινιάρα το Contact και θέτει ένα πολύ σοβαρό ερώτημα για το αν θα ""τράβαγαμε την πρίζα"" από το ανθρώπινο γένος εφόσον είχαμε τη δυνατότητα να το κάνουμε.
Επιπλέον περιγράφει πολύ ρεαλιστικά την Επανάσταση του Μάο με σκηνές που σου ρχεται να κοπάνας το κεφάλι σου στον τοίχο ( εκτέλεση επιστημόνων, παιδιά εθνοφρουροί και άλλα τέτοια καραγκιοζιλίκια)
Γιατί όχι 10? Γιατί οι χαρακτήρες του είναι τελείως επίπεδοι και οι πρώτες 150 σελίδες κυλούν αργά με πολλά κινέζικα ονόματα.

In my life, distractions (aka children), abound and because of this, I had to reread whole paragraphs because I was like “physics physics LILLY, DO NOT EAT YOUR BOOGERS physics aliens Galileo ROSEMARY, PLZ STOP GRABBING THE CAT’S TAIL physics blood bugs.”

I actually shelved this book for quite some time before picking it back up when I was in a better headspace for it. I think the plot itself is quite compelling, and this book probably serves as the set up to the real action in the rest of the trilogy, but the storytelling suffered a bit from weak characters and a lack of detail.

It seemed quite flat, with no emotions. The characters were just grey. The back and forth between reality and the game was a bit confusing, and I don't think it added much to the story. All the logic behind it didn't seem possible or appealing.

"Ķīniešiem ar zinātnisko fantastiku bija pavisam knapi, ja pēckara gados viņi blieza augšā sociālajā reālismā balstītus darbus, kas, iespējams, kvalitatīvi izglītoja jauno paaudzi populārzinātniskajās tēmās, taču es personīgi neatminos, ka būtu no tiem ko lasījis. Iespējams, ka kādā padomjlaiku antoloģijā ir lasīts kāds ķīniešu autors, taču atmiņā nekas nav aizķēries. Kultūras revolūcijas laikā zinātniskajai fantastikai vietas neatradās vispār, būvējot jaunu iekārtu nav laika fantazēt. Un tad deviņdesmitajos parādījās tā saucamie Trīs Ķīnas Zinātniskās fantastikas ģenerāļi, viens no tiem ir šīs grāmatas autors. Ar šo grāmatu es biju informēts jau labu laiku, daži atsaucēs apgalvoja, ka labākais, kas redzēts kopš Artura Klārka darbiem, citi - ka kaut kāds gīkisks samistrojums. Nolēmu pārbaudīt patiesību pats.

Stāsts sākas Ķīnas Kultūras Revolūcijas laikā, jaunā zinātniece Yu Wenjie ir spiesta noskatīties, kā aktīvist piekauj viņas tēvu līdz nāvei, jo šis redz esot nepareizi pasniedzis fiziku. Viņa pati tiek nosūtīta darba nometnē meža darbos. Tomēr viņai paveicas, un viņa nonāk slepenā ķīniešu kara bāzē, kas oficiāli nodarbojas ar radioastronomiju, bet patiesībā meklē ārpuszemes civilizācijas. Mūsdienās kāds nanotehnoloģisko materiālu zinātnieks Wang Miao pašam negribot tiek iesaistīts, kādas milzīgas konspirācijas atšķetināšanā. Pasaulē notiek kaut kas tāds, kas satrauc visu pasaules lielāko valdību drošības dienestus. Ir aizdomas, ka neliela cilvēku grupa savās rokās ir dabūjusi nezemes tehnoloģiju, dīvainās nāvēs mirst vadošie zinātnieki, un šķiet, ka fiziķi ir saskārušies ar neizskaidrojamu fenomenu. Pirmais pavediens ir kāda virtuālās realitātes spēle Trīs ķermeņu problēma.

Patiešām galvenie varoņi nav diez ko pārliecinoši, tie ir ideju nesēji un no mūsu kultūras viedokļa skatoties pilnīgi fatālisti. Viņi kuļas pa savu dzīvi neizjūtot nekādas īpašās emocijas un, tā teikt, dara savu labo vai ļauno darbu. Šajā ziņā ļaunie bija pat pievilcīgāki, varēja vismaz saprast to motivāciju, atrast izskaidrojumu tam, kādēļ viņi ir vīlušies cilvēku izveidotajā civilizācijā. Dažiem tie ir sīki aizvainojumi, dažiem - svešo pielūgsme, citiem - auksts aprēķins. Labie šajā ziņa nevar izcelties ar īpašu koordinētību un dzēš vienu ugunsgrēku pēc otra.

Grāmatas centrālā tēma – ko darīt ar ārpuszemes civilizācijām? Vai sēdēt klusu savās mājās, it kā mēs atrastos tumšā mežā. Turēt muti un izturēties tā, lai neviens mums nepievērstu uzmanību. Jo mežā bļaujot jau nekad nevar zināt, kas atsauksies. Iespējams, ka tās būs draudzīgas saprātīgas būtnes, ar kurām varēs sadarboties. Iespējams, ka tās būs iekarotājas, kuras jebkuru citu saprāta izpausmi Visumā uzskatīs par konkurentiem, kuri jāiznīcina. Zemes cilvēki savu izvēli jau ir izdarījuši, viņi mežā brēc kā aizkauts sivēns, un ir tikai laika jautājums, līdz tos kāds pamanīs.
Ar zinātniskās fantastikas daļu nudien viss ir kārtībā. Autors ir spēcīgs pasaules būvētājs, un viņa izveidotā citplanētiešu ekosistēma nudien ir kaut kas unikāls un līdz šim neredzēts. Ir diezgan grūti iztēloties pasauli, kura riņķo ap veselām trīs zvaigznēm, visu laiku neprognozējami mainot orbītu, laiku pa laikam visu sasaldējot vai sadedzinot. Taču autors ir pacenties un radījis ticamu Trisolāru civilizāciju, kuras evolūcijai varam izsekot daudzu ciklu garumā. Lai ar dažas autora idejas nonāk pretrunā ar pamata sižeta līniju. Daži Trisolāru atklājumi paši par sevi ir rīki viņu problēmu atrisināšanai, taču autors spītīgi cenšas to neievērot un nemaitā stāstu ar to, ka galvenie varoņi pēkšņi attopas un saka, kādēļ mēs ķēpājamies, ja visas savas problēmas varam atrisināt tūlīt.

Grāmatai lieku 10 no 10 ballēm. Iesaku izlasīt visiem, jā, pirmā puse, iespējams, būs pasmaga, taču ja līdz šim neko nezināt par Kultūras Revolūcijas ikdienu, tad iegūsiet ieskatu Ķīnas jauno laiku vēsturē. Zinātniskās fantastikas daļa savukārt liks paskatīties uz daudzām lietām no īpaša skatu punkta. Ko darīt, ja mēs tiešām Visumā neesam vienīgie?

PS. Pēc grāmatas izlasīšanas brīžos, kad nenāks miegs varēsiet padomāt par tēmu, ko mēs Zemes iedzīvotāji darītu ja zinātu, ka kaut kur ārā ir saprātīgas būtnes, kuras mūs novēro un, iespējams, kaldina plānus mūsu iznīcināšanai.

For clarification sake; I have received a copy of The Three-Body Problem through netgalley.com, but I ended up reading a copy that I bought and listening to the audiobook through the library instead. See my remarks regarding the audiobook narrated by Luke Daniels .

It ticks my boxes for plot and world-building, but there’s something about that makes me hesitate to give it a full on 5/5 stars rating, and placing it amongst my favourite titles. Perhaps it is the undercurrent of propaganda or just the tonality of that is unfamiliar to me. I would definitely recommend taking a look at the written format of in order to read the characters’ names - as I have a problem with placing the spoken unfamiliar names.

I have had this title in the back of my mind for years, and I have picked it up a couple of times, but never gotten past the first couple of pages. I think the fact that there’s a list of characters in the beginning is tricking me to think that this is a bit harder to get into. It was therefore a bit surprising that was very easy to get into.

How do you translate a Chinese work for a western audience? It was fascinating to be able to see some of the choices regarding the translation.

There is also a loaded backdrop to which brings Chinese history and politics to the forefront and into the background, mainly the . Ken Liu did a good job at translating this for, primarily western audiences, and I especially noticed some of the nuances which Ken Liu also comments on in his postscript: “.

"Für Wissenschaftsfreaks definitiv spannend, da ich aber nur die Hälfte verstanden habe leider recht zäh ...

Diesen Buchtipp hab ich von einer ebenfalls großen Lesebegeisterten auf Facbebook aufgeschnappt und nachdem sie so davon geschwärmt und mir der Klappentext zugesagt hatte, wollte ich unbedingt wissen was es damit auf sich hat.
Die Erwartungen, die die Buchinfo in mir geschürt hat und die Vorfreude durch die Begeisterung anderer von der Geschichte sind leider nicht wirklich erfüllt worden. Kontakt mit Außerirdischen aufnehmen und die Konsequenzen zu erfahren, das hab ich für mich rausgelesen - allerdings passiert das ganze erst am Ende des Buches. Der Anfang ist zwar an sich wichtig und schlägt eine lange Brücke bis es tatsächlich soweit ist, hätte aber um einiges sehr gekürzt werden können.

Science Fiction = wissenschaftliche Fiktion, und zwar volle Kanone ohne Punkt und Komma mit dem Hauptaugenmerkt auf Wissenschaft und Technik.
Während ich auf den ersten Seiten noch gerätselt habe, was diese ""Kulturrevolution"" in China mit dem Thema zu tun hat, wurde ich dann mit naturwissenschaftlichen und technischen Fragen und Begriffen nur so bombardiert. Ich interessiere mich sehr für physikalische Fragen, denn sie erklären mir das Leben und können tatsächlich auch ein wenig Licht hinter den Sinn der Dinge bringen, aber hier hatte ich immer das Gefühl, nicht auf den Punkt zu kommen. Mit wissenschaftlichen Wörtern wird nicht gegeizt, von der Erzählweise her aber eher umständlich und auch sehr trocken und vor allem: ohne mir tatsächlich Klarheit zu bringen über das was ich da grade momentan lese, aber auch darüber, wohin das führen soll.
Natürlich muss nicht immer alles von vornherein deutlich sein, man mag ja auch Spannung und Überraschungen erleben, aber da ich oft keine Ahnung hatte, worum es da genau geht, war das sehr schwierig für mich. Ich fühlte mich dann auch oft richtig ""doof"", weil ich so viel nicht verstanden habe und der Drang, einige Seiten zu überblättern war groß.

Ich war zuerst wirklich lange enthusiastisch weil ich einfach wollte, dass mir diese Geschichte gefällt und ich immer darauf gewartet hatte, dass es JETZT soweit ist und der Knoten bei mir platzt. Es ist auch nicht so, dass ich es total schlecht fand, aber die gewisse Würze fehlte einfach - und vor allem das Verständnis.
Gefühle oder ähnliches bleiben völlig außen vor, auch wenn mal Tränen (im Buch, nicht bei mir) vergossen werden, hat selbst mein empathisches Herz kaum Regung gezeigt. Das fand ich zwar gar nicht mal so schlimm und auch mit den Zeitsprüngen kam ich gut klar, wenn einfach alles etwas schneller vorangegangen wäre. Dadurch wirkte es sehr zäh und langatmig.

Die Hintergründe zu einer der Hauptfiguren, Ye Wenjie und wie das ganze zusammenhängt, kommen erst sehr spät - die haben mich zwar überraschen können, mehr oder weniger, und das ganze hatte dann tatsächlich seinen Reiz, aber eben viel zu spät.
Einen wichtigen Ansatz fand ich bei dem ganzen Thema diejenigen Menschen, die eine Hoffnung, einen positiven Glauben in sich tragen, die stets versuchen, dass sich die Menschheit wieder auf einen ""besseren"" Pfad besinnt und nachdem sie aber erkennen, oder glauben zu erkennen, dass das nicht eintreffen wird, in ein hoffnungsloses Tief fallen. Und daraus dann Entscheidungen resultieren, die weitreichende Folgen haben können.

Trotz vieler Versuche, mich positiv mit dem vielen Wissen auseinanderzusetzen, dass mir hier zuhauf präsentiert wird, bin ich wohl an meinem eigenen Verstand gescheitert, weil ich die Hälfte schlicht und ergreifend nicht kapiert hab. Sehr schade, denn viele der Ansätze hatte ich schon gehört und hätte gerne auf meinem Niveau mehr darüber gelernt.

Wen das Buch interessiert sollte sich im Klaren darüber sein, dass es eine lange Entwicklung ist (die am Ende aber viel Potenzial für die Fortsetzungen verspricht) und keine typische, actionreiche Alieninvasion oder ähnliches, was man aus dem Genre so kennt und man mit viel technischem und physikalischem Kenntnissen konfrontiert wird.

"I came across this book when I was listening to Tor podcast, when they were airing episode regarding sci fi nominations for Hugo's. Also reading a completely new author always excites me, and the top cherry was I got this book way too cheap on amazon. Three body problem although has same theme as the movie but it focuses more on how humans will react to such a situation.

Some of the strong points of book are




Some of the weaker points of book are




Let me expand on strong points of the book



The book basically starts when the red revolution in is at its zenith, but unfortunately the red guards have divided themselves into factions and have started infighting. As is always the case the common people are the ones who are suffering the most in such a case. The red guards are especially targeting intellectuals whom they are blaming for teaching capitalist science.



One of the professors of physics falls prey to this madness, and his daughter gets devastated. Although being a physicist herself she is sent by the government to work with workers who are in charge of cutting a large area of forests in order to make way for farming. She notices the senseless destruction of a very old forest and slowly starts realizing that human beings are completely destroying everything for their own selfish needs.



Due to her background in physics she gets deputed to a secret project called as where in the Chinese government is sending signals in outer space in order to contact any extraterrestrial life. One day by fluke she receives an signal from an extraterrestrial life, and she takes her revenge on humanity by giving away earth's co-ordinates.





We switch back to present where in a nano material researcher is called by police to help investigate deaths in scientific community. During the course of investigation he comes across the game . Once he starts exploring the game we come to know how the the game is connected to contact with extraterrestrials.

Although the book is an exciting read but it definitely suffers from below weak points



Although this can be classified as my issue alone while reading the book, but it was terribly difficult to make out all the different characters in this book as their names sound so similar to each other.



This book is definitely not a character driven book, but it is an plot driven book where in author just uses the characters at hand to forward the plot of the book. Except the character I was not able to connect to any of the characters.

I am giving this book 4/5 stars and I am definitely excited to read the next book in series.

"A finales de los años 60, en plena Revolución Cultural china, Ye Weinje ve morir a su padre y su hermana menor de manera sangrienta en el marco de la guerra de facciones. Su madre pierde la razón y Weinje termina en un campamento dedicado a arrasar bosques para allanar el camino del progreso.

La mezcla de intrigas políticas y su formación científica, hace que termine en la enigmática base militar de Costa Roja, de la que ha sido advertida, no podrá volver a salir.

La base se dedica aparentemente a bloquear la acción de satélites que promueven el ideal capitalista, pero Weinje sabe que la infraestructura y el alto nivel de secreto con que se maneja la información que allí se genera, encierra mucho más. Así que su curiosidad e irrefrenable impertinencia la llevará a descubrir el verdadero objetivo de Costa Roja; Ye Weinje, una Astrofísica que se salva de morir y de padecer un aplastante juicio político, se convierte en el primer ser humano en establecer contacto con una civilización extraterrestre.

Mientras tanto, los científicos más prolíficos de China empiezan a suicidarse, sin que se conozcan las razones. Las fuerzas armadas de todos los países se han unido para enfrentar a un enemigo que no han identificado y un juego de realidad virtual de enorme complejidad se ha convertido en el pretexto para reunir a intelectuales y millonarios de todo el mundo en lo que parece ser una nueva religión.

Lo anterior es un resumen forzado de un libro altamente complejo, inquietante, divertido, acaso terrorífico y novedoso que da inicio a la trilogía de “El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos”. Forzado porque sería imposible seguir hablando de él sin dar “spoilers”.

Así que hablemos más del libro y menos de la trama ...

Cixin Liu ha escrito una historia tan enorme como las once dimensiones que se esconden en el microcosmos de un átomo (lo que describe también en la novela). El autor dice que “las historias más destacadas y bonitas que ha creado el ser humano no han sido contadas por los poetas o los novelistas, sino por la ciencia” y que, sin embargo, “estas historias se encuentran encriptadas por ecuaciones frías que la mayoría de la gente no entiende”.

Así que, en esta narración vertiginosa y apabullante, el autor ha logrado volver asequibles, aprehensibles y hasta divertidos, conceptos científicos crípticos y altamente complejos, sin tornarlos triviales.

Los personajes centrales son sólidos y se insertan perfectamente en la trama. Las descripciones científicas de elementos de la Física Cuántica a veces hacen que uno se pierda, pero en general son cruciales para la historia y despiertan gran emoción además de una larga serie de interrogantes en el lector.

El trabajo del escritor ha sido de filigrana (de filigrana cuántica), logrando mezclar de manera magistral (he dicho de muchas novelas que son narraciones magistrales, pero esta sin duda está a años luz) la ciencia ficción, la novela policíaca, el thriller, el misterio, la ciencia básica y hasta la historia de amor. Sin olvidar que en el fondo se percibe un mensaje que reclama conciencia ambiental y respeto por la vida.

Hace mucho no leía una novela tan tremendamente cautivadora, interesante y emocionante. La narración no deja cabos sueltos, funciona como una novela independiente y además deja sembrada la curiosidad para el siguiente libro de la trilogía. Impresionante. Es impresionante.
El cerebro de Cixin Liu es un universo insondable y su obra es un regalo inmenso. Ni más ni menos.

"This review and others can be found on my blog, Fine Print.

Get ready y’all, because it’s CONTROVERSIAL OPINION TIME.

Let me just get this out of the way right now: no one is more disappointed than I am that I didn’t like this book. Chinese science fiction with two interconnected narratives and a police procedural vibe? I should’ve loved this like virtually everyone else did (especially since I enjoyed Cixin Liu’s short fiction in Invisible Planets). But sadly I did not.

THE THREE BODY PROBLEM is, firstly, an incredibly dense read. There’s rarely a page that goes by that doesn’t discuss physics problems, issues in theoretical frontier science, or make reference to famous physicists. What should be an absolute page-turner is completely bogged down by what I felt was the author’s attempt to school the masses (i.e. me) on the beauty of hard science, an opinion that was only strengthened by the author’s note at the end of the novel. Obviously there are many readers out there who heard this message and it spoke to them, but unfortunately I found it quite pretentious and somewhat impenetrable at times.

The basic plot of THE THREE BODY PROBLEM is as follows:

In one narrative, young astrophysicist Ye Wenjie is blackballed during the Cultural Revolution and essentially forced to work on a top-secret military base that claims to study satellites. In the second narrative, nano materials researcher Wang Miao is tapped by an international task force to infiltrate an elite club of scientists to discover how they’re connected to the rash of suicides among prominent scientists across the globe. Sounds intriguing, right? It was at first, but the plot kept getting sidelined for tens of pages of dialogue about physics theory. Puzzling out how the two stories are connected was fun, but despite the high stakes for both Ye and Wang I found it difficult to connect to them as characters.

Ye is at least a sympathetic character, after her horrible experiences during the Cultural Revolution. Her grief in the wake of her father’s execution, her ardent environmentalism and concern for China’s forests, and her tenacity all made Ye someone I could root for. I found myself looking forward to her next set of POV chapters as soon as they ended…although that may be because I loathed Wang’s POV chapters. When he begins to guess at the conspiracy behind everything going on, Wang completely loses it and scares the crap out his wife and kid – then he doesn’t spare them a thought for the rest of the novel. No, instead he spends his emotional energy waxing poetic about the love he had for a brilliant and beautiful scientist whom he had literally never spoken to before. Honestly, his narration felt a bit too gentleman’s club-y and borderline sexist for me to enjoy it at all.

I see why other readers love this book – it has some pretty epic reveals and plot twists, and discusses some pretty high level moral ideas – but I am not in agreement. It’s not until about the 60% mark of THE THREE BODY PROBLEM that these exciting events occur, and I found it difficult to stay engaged up until that point. If I hadn’t been buddy reading this with Becky, I probably would’ve put it aside unfinished.

All that said, I am happy that I’ve read more Chinese science fiction, and I do plan to read more in the future…it just won’t be novels written by Cixin Liu.

"""The Universe consists of non-simultaneously apprehended events"" - Buckminster Fuller

There is this one particular scene where author explains how a 2D surface when unfolded contains more surface area for adsorption than its higher dimensional 3D form, with the example of a cigarette filter. Having given this analogy, later cleverly segues into unfolding of proton which according to him is of 11 dimensions. This is the beauty of Three Body Problem, everything you require to pelt along the plot is right in front, kindling your scientific mind, like a movie.

I consider of a dimension higher than my usual perception, proper unfolding of which requires general understanding of engineering, physics, etiology, Chinese history, so on and so forth. Many allegories and references might have been lost in translation for English readers, who like me conclude the internecine civil unrest in China by a single red word - . Initial Red army prosecution of for his reactionary ideas to the plight of or , Red coast base for covert cold war weaponry, initial extremist transmissions for blind espousals, racial and communal fascism for officious government, scrupulous research for reservation of education, chaotic eras for Earth’s prime extinction events, for religious invocation , miracles and religion in general were a few that caught my eye.

As for the characters, though not coterminous, they were well developed for their roles, given proper background for their actions, allowing a character pov, from the Physicists , Nano research engineer to the arrogant Police officer . The joy of discovering post convection zone reflectivity of Sun by and the explanation of same was some of the finest science description I’ve ever encountered. Absolutely loved how they kept the mystery of Trisolarians till the end, though it was constantly teased through game plot of three body. Similarly the unfolding of Proton and the reaction of microcosmos on its first encounter with a higher dimension were highly thought provoking, bating the significance of our existence in the vastness of universe. And author was careful in keeping the Trisolarians on technologically comparable scale with their limitations rather than making them a highly Type 3 civilization.

I would advice a blind read, without any peek into the plot for the book cleverly holds back info, like the first Red Coast base did with Ye Wenjie. Perhaps the most science-y hard sci fi I have read till now, well written and translated, where it was way easier to consider the flummoxing science as something scholarly advanced than carefully crafted fiction. And was considerate enough to give it a layman treatment where even the seemingly unintentional data dumps were secretly training readers for the intricacy of the plot that followed.

High quality of this book make me suspect a vastly unexplored sci fi scene from mainland China, which like Trisolarians, if could, would proton print these words to my retina.

Rating: 4.5?

I've been really into soft scifi for a while now, so it was about time for me to try some proper hard scifi! I was expecting the worst (my knowledge of physics is limited to what I've managed to absorb from pop culture, high school physics, and educational youtube channels) but I feel that the author did a great job explaining the relevant scientific concepts here in ways that are fairly easy to comprehend even if you don't have much background knowledge.

I actually found myself being way more confused about the plot than the scientific concepts, but by the end of the book, the majority of my questions had been answered which was a pleasant surprise, I was afraid that I'd have to wait one or two more books for answers. I went into this book without any knowledge of the plot since it was a recommendation, and I am honestly so glad that I did, because I feel that the book's summary gives away too much of the plot. If I'd read the summary, I would have spent a good chunk of the book waiting for plot points to show up, instead of theorising and being really intrigued about what was going on. I've been having this issue with lots of books recently, but I guess it's a bit of a catch-22 since it's hard to promote a book if you can't advertise its plot properly 🤷

Honestly, I went into the book expecting it to be maybe a bit dry and boring, but this wasn't the case at all. The writing style was very no-frills, but I actually rather prefer a more direct style like this, over one that waffles on and on and on and I can't even remember what paragraph is about by the time I reach its end. I was engaged by the story from the very beginning, and I think that the pacing was very well done, although the ending felt a bit abrupt.

The scifi here is mostly some very real feeling elements that sound like they could plausibly happen in real life, but there are definitely some technologies used that feel almost fantastical (maybe I'm just lacking in scientific knowledge though). I think that my main issue was the plot point about the VR game, although the majority of my confusion regrading its purpose/mechanics/etc. was eventually resolved, it still feels like a rather strange part of the plot for me.

The characters were... Interesting. My knee-jerk reaction is to say that I can't connect with them at all, but the more I think about it, the more I realise that's not true, they're just rather morally grey/complex, so I haven't quite formed my opinions of them yet. This is only the start of the series though, so my opinions on them will be clearer later on.

Overall I think that the plot of this story was very well thought out and executed, it didn't wow me, but I'll definitely be continuing with the series.

Bonus Fact: The Bob's Burgers episode 'UFO Oh No You Didn't' does a parody of this book! It's a really fun episode and I'd recommend watching it :D

"Lol this is why people make fun of (me and my fellow) nerds.

I loved the Three-Body game and it's development. I thought the game, its premise, and its characters were deeply interesting. The physics discussions were also very cool (🤓). But I found myself caring less about the human world and even less about the eventual contact with the ""others."" I am interested to see how the show portrays all of this.

Definitely a good sci-fi read, but go in knowing that you're gonna have to have physics book open to appreciate it.

"Idee niesamowite, ale warsztatowo wielkie rozczarowanie.

Nie chodzi nawet o samych bohaterów, gdzie w zasadzie znamy motywacje tylko jednej z nich. Reszta jest tak płaska i jednowymiarowa, służy tylko pchnięciu akcji niczym deus ex machina do przodu. Dość wspomnieć, że w odpowiednich momentach pojawia się doszczętnie stereotypowy gliniarz (a później wojskowi), naukowiec w wybitnie temu odpowiadającej okazji idzie do pewnej staruszki, co popycha fabułę do przodu. Wszystko tak przypadkowe, że zaplanowane prawie co do godziny. W samej grze, co na końcu zyskuje pewne wytłumaczenie, ale nie likwiduje goryczy, postaci historyczne (Einstein, Kopernik, itd.) również są wybitnie stereotypowe, a przez to nudne i żenujące. Oczywiście tam, gdzie trzeba i gdzie autorowi pasuje, mamy formę sprawozdania. Wszystko służy jedynie jako nośnik idei i tylko idee mają tu stanowić formę ""rozrywki"".

Tym większe zaskoczenie, bo początkowa część, ta historyczna, była naprawdę magiczna - pięknie napisana, chyba z 1/3 treści zanotowałem. Ale gdy właściwa akcja się zaczyna, wszystko opada w żenujące i przedmiotowe wykorzystanie historii do prezentacji swoich wyobrażeń (zupełnie jakby wstęp napisał ktoś inny).

Wybitnie rozczarowujące, jak na tak wysoko oceniane dzieło.

To, co nie rozczarowuje, to doprawdy wspaniałe idee i pomysły, które są całkiem interesujące i świeże. Jest tu kilka niedociągnięć, ale jako fikcja sprawdza się dość poprawnie. Ogólnie autor ma sporą wiedzę techniczną i orientuje się w nauce, co bardzo dobrze widać w książce.

Mamy tu rozwój cywilizacji, historię nauki i społeczeństwa, problem trzech ciał, informatykę (komputer z ludzi!), nanotechnologię, akceleratory, sterowane protony zwinięte w wymiarach i wykorzystujące splątanie kwantowe do komunikacji, ludzi z którymi niepotrzebnie walczymy oraz oczywiście Obcych, których zamiary są identyczne z ludzkimi.

""Przed insektami nie trzeba chować butelki z płynem owadobójczym"", ale też ""insekty nigdy nie zostały pokonane"".

Ciekawie widać próbę wpływu Obcych na rozwój nauki (jednak czy naprawdę naukowcy popełniają samobójstwo jak coś im nie wyjdzie?), używanie splątań kwantowych zbytnio uproszczone (nawet autor wprost pisze, że nie chciał tego zbytnio tłumaczyć, no ciekawe dlaczego, hmm), no i do tego komunikacja z obcymi za pomocą autodekodera. No ciekawe na jaki język tłumaczył i jak tłumaczył emocje. Do tego planeta poddawana wpływom trzech gwiazd jest dość skromnie opisana, pewnie dlatego, że szczegóły niespecjalnie pasowałyby do wizji autora.

Wielką wartością jest tu też ukazanie historii Chin i realiów rewolucji, tamtejszego i ówczesnego myślenia. Ogólnie obecność idei politycznych i filozoficznych była mi miła.

Gdyby autor zapisał swoje idee w formie eseju, tak jak uczynił to poniekąd w posłowiu, byłoby to świetne. Niestety zapisał to w formie fatalnej stylistycznie ""bajki"", w którą trudno uwierzyć, choć jest piękna. Rozmach światów przerósł autora. A mogło być pięknie i nawet przynajmniej dwa razy dłużej, ale na spokojnie.

Oceniając bardziej jako dzieło literackie - 3/5, ale ponieważ idee są tak niezwykłe, daję ostatecznie gwiazdkę więcej.

"This is probably the highest rating I've given to a book that caused me to fall asleep every 10 pages or so... but in a good way. It's hard going, not anything to do with the writing, just the subject matter. Quantum and string theory. Well articulated, but I tired easily. I'd call this a hard-SF novel, but I doubted the ability of life/civilization to survive the kind of chaotic environment described on Trisolaris. So while the physics and math I think are right on it, I didn't buy the evolutionary biology, to the extent that it was articulated, which wasn't very much, actually. The only kind of creature I could imagine meeting the description would be some kind of sentient plant life. Which would be interesting, and I suppose we'll find out in the sequels.

Also the book starts out with a long exposition on the history of Chinese Communism. This is very important to the development of the characters and consequently the plot, but I can imagine that it might disorienting to some readers. Personally, I found it fascinating.

I confess that at times this book felt similar in tone and weirdness to Vladimir Sorokin's Ice Trilogy. It's interesting to think about how the experiences of the Cultural Revolution and Stalinism might have resulted in these novel sequences.

Despite all the background we were given, I had a hard time grasping the motives of those who wanted to bring the Trisolarans to Earth. I also wasn't sure if Ye had changed her views of them (And if so, why? The blocking of scientific inquiry on Earth? Was she really surprised by their nature?), or was celebrating what she had done at the end. Again, I suppose this will be revealed. Or perhaps not. Perhaps the next book jumps centuries into the future. Also, the revelation that the Trisolarns make to the Adventists just didn't read right--didn't believe they'd say all that, or present it in a narrative that looked anything like that.

I was also interested in and a bit uncomfortable with the reference to the Trisolaran people collectively as ""Our Lord."" What the author turned out to be saying about the religious impulse was compelling, but I wondered if a Western society would be able to view another civilization as an entity.

In the afterword, Liu claims he wasn't trying to make any political or social statements about Chinese history, culture, its treatment of the environment, environmentalists, or humanity in general. That reminded me of Ursula Le Guin's insistence that her work is never allegorial. Bull on both counts...

Looking forward to the chance to mull some of the ideas presented here in the next book.

"I had already moved this to the top of my to-read list prior to Worldcon, but when it won the Hugo in front of me, it vaulted up my list even more quickly. Ken Liu is brilliant, and anything he was involved in was instantly going to be a must-read for me. I went into this book not necessarily with insanely high expectations, but moreso with high hopes. I wanted this book to very much live up to it's Hugo-winning hype. To be the visionary novel that it was billed as. Was it?



Cixin Liu has very nicely created a scenario and situation that is full of imagination, intrigue, and suspense. At once feeling like other novels, as well as like very little else I've read, it was mostly well executed, and undeniably creative. The writing quality is high, and the translation is exceptional, giving the book the feel of having been crafted in English originally. There's undeniably Chinese cultural aspects and views, while still giving the reader the feeling of familiarity and understanding, of knowing what the characters are going through without actually having been in that situation.

The book does, however, lose focus about halfway through. The initial buildup is a bit slow in itself, and then when things start picking up, it seems to wander a bit - not in a Neil Gaiman ""journey before the destination"" type of thing, but in a ""just meandering from the point"" kind of way. It will go from a fairly broad scope, to long periods of focusing on one person and events, back to a large group and back to a smaller one, over and over, which can be a bit distracting.

The development of the alien race, the video game reveal, and the transition into their inner-circle discussions is very interesting, and was a blast to watch unravel. However, it was done a bit clumsily at times, jumping from one group to the next, then coming back with small snippets at the other. It was very inventive, but also a bit jarring as it transitioned.

Overall, the book was *good*, but not *great* in my opinion. It had a ton of promise, it had some really good writing, and amazing ideas and concepts. However, it just wasn't perfect execution in my eyes. I never really felt like the book was 'written for people smarter than me' as some reviewers had said or hinted, nor do I feel that I ""missed the point"" or anything - I just was not totally keen on all of the design choices. I understand why it won the Hugo, though my opinion that Goblin Emperor should have won was only strengthened by reading this book (this had no bearing on my feelings towards this book, but I was rooting for Addison anyway).

I it a lot, I didn't it.

"Ero molto curioso per questo romanzo di fantascienza cinese, nominato per premi prestigiosi, di un autore che a quanto capisco è tra i massimi esponenti del genere in patria.
Ero molto curioso soprattutto perché non sapevo come si fosse sviluppato il genere in un contesto a lungo abbastanza ""chiuso"" come quello cinese, con un passato recente molto particolare e una tradizione millenaria come fondamenta.

Alla fine ho trovato un romanzo molto ""classico"", pieno di scienza (si nota lievemente la formazione scientifica dell'autore) e con una buona idea di fondo.

Purtroppo però ci ho trovato anche parecchie pecche, riassumibili tendenzialmente in ""fino a oltre metà libro il mio interesse era quasi nullo"".
Si inizia con salti temporali che rapidamente ci portano dalla Rivoluzione Culturale fino al presente (e che sembrano quasi messi lì tanto per compiacere il pubblico), e quando finalmente si parte con quella che dovrebbe essere la storia, questa procede estremamente a rilento.

Si capisce poco della trama vera e propria, i personaggi sembrano molto distanti e irreali, e la parte peggiore direi che è ""Tre corpi"", il videogioco immersivo: non si capisce se sia un gioco in single player o un gioco online dove si interagisce con gli altri; sembrerebbe il secondo caso, ma a volte i personaggi si comportano come meri png, e -cosa più importante- ogni volta che Wang entra nel gioco, si ritrova al centro dell'azione (per modo di dire), come se gli eventi aspettassero lui per mettersi in moto. E anche i ""livelli"" di gioco, viene da pensare a un gioco ""da giocatore singolo"" visto che dubito tutti quanti fossero rimasti fermi a riflettere sul problema per mesi, per anni, finché questo ricercatore di nanomateriali arriva e in poco tempo tira fuori i tre corpi. Però la cosa è molto fumosa, molto nebulosa.

Non mi convince neanche la comunicazione tra i due sistemi: mandare segnali, ok. Ma decifrarli traducendoli nel linguaggio di destinazione? Possedere addirittura riferimenti culturali, mentali e materiali anche solo paragonabili? Parecchio irreale, più da fumetto che da fantascienza del terzo millennio.


Ciò detto, quando finalmente si smette di tergiversare e si entra nella parte finale del libro le cose prendono ritmo e soprattutto acquistano spessore e interesse, l'idea è interessante e probabilmente gli darò una seconda possibilità col seguito.
Ma mi aspettavo molto di più, inutile negarlo.

"Necesito un descanso del cyberpunk mal hecho. A veces me aburre su carácter mundano y doméstico. Estoy harto de su inofensiva, repetitiva e interminable denuncia a las corporaciones: que ""el país Wal-Mart""; que ""el continente Costco"". Lo entiendo, el capitalismo es malo, ¿eso es lo único que nos tiene que decir este género literario?

También me desespera su rollo especulativo facilón del tipo ""en el futuro habrá una píldora que te permitirá obtener un conocimiento infinito"".

Sé que estoy siendo injusto y prejuicioso, y que el buen cyberpunk también toca temas importantes como el transhumanismo, nuestra interacción con los medios de comunicación y la exploración de mundos virtuales, sin embargo, prefiero la ciencia ficción que al menos toma en cuenta la existencia de algo tan abrumadoramente vasto como es el espacio exterior.

""Pero alguna vez se habrá sentido admirado al ver las estrellas. ¿No despiertan su curiosidad?"", le dice un personaje a otro en EL PROBLEMA DE LOS TRES CUERPOS.

Contrario a lo que algunos piensan, no toda la space opera es optimista. Ahí está el ejemplo de Alastair Reynolds, quien maneja un horror espacial bastante lovecraftiano. Sin embargo, hay un problema con este género literario: o es demasiado fantasioso, o es demasiado serio y plano. Por ejemplo, a pesar de ser muy galáctico, las leyes de la física no juegan un factor importante en lo que hace Iain M. Banks, aunque sus personajes son bastante interesantes. En ese sentido su literatura es más cercana a la fantasía que a la ciencia. Luego tienes novelas como CITA CON RAMA, que está bien cimentada sobre principios científicos, pero sus personajes son olvidables.

La ventaja de Cixin Liu es que maneja conceptos científicos alucinantes, pero, al mismo tiempo, aporta personajes memorables y complejos. Lo otro que me gustó de EL PROBLEMA DE LOS TRES CUERPOS es lo mismo que me gusta de EL LLAMADO DE CTHULHU y EL HORROR DE DUNWICH: la existencia de cultos apocalípticos que conspiran contra su propia especie. Ese tema me fascina.

Mis personajes favoritos fueron el junior-jipi-abraza-árboles-que-se-vuelve-líder-de-la-secta-trisolariana y el matemático que resuelve el problema de los tres cuerpos en un templo budista.

El único pasaje que me pareció flojón, muy churro serie B, es el ambientado en el Canal de Panamá, cuando un buque es partido en dos por un nano material llamado ""la daga voladora"". A pesar de esto, le doy cinco estrellitas a la novela.

"Üç Cisim Problemi - Cixin Liu

Kesinlikle kendi okuma standartıma göre hızlı bir okuma olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Şerhlerim olacak ancak genel olarak kendisini okutan, akıcı, sürükleyici bir eser. Orijinal bir konusu var, okurken heyecan uyandıran bir eser. Klişelerin dışında bir hikaye en azından ben şimdiye kadar bu şekilde işlenmiş bir ilk temas hikayesi okumadım. Yazar gerçekten güzel bir yerden kurgulamış hikayeyi.

Kitap çok güzel bir yerde bitiyor. Hikayenin konusunu ve nasıl gelişeceğini aslında kitabı bitirdiğimizde anlayabiliyoruz ancak. Bu da güzel bir şey, çember veya spiral metaforunda olduğu gibi hikayenin kendini tamamlaması ve yeni hikayenin başlaması hikaye anlatım tekniği açısından son derece başarılı bir şekilde uygulanmış bence.

Doğrusunu söylemek gerekirse kitabın bir çok olumlu yönü var ancak kendi adıma kusursuz bir eser olduğunu söyleyemeyeceğim.

Çin politakasıyla ilgili bölümleri genel olarak zorlama buldum. Bu bölümler kısa tutulsaydı bence daha iyi olabilirdi.

Hikayeyi sürükleyecek ve hikayenin onun etrafında şekilleneceği bir ana karakterin olmaması, bu bence bir problem. Genel olarak karakter gelişimi göremiyoruz. Empati yapabileceğimiz veya kendimizle özdeştireceğimiz bir baskın karakter de yok açıkcası.
Karakter odaklı bir hikaye değil, burada ana karakter dünya denilebilir ancak bu da söz konusu değil hikaye oldukça dar bir çerçeveden ele alınıyor.
Aslında ana karakterler belli ancak bu karakterler ile okurun bütünleşmesi için bir fırsat sunmamış yazar. Karakterleri yüzeysel buldum.

Bir takım grupların motivasyonlarını ikna edici bulmadım. Spoiler vermek istemediğim için üstü kapalı anlatacağım. Hayatınızdan, sevdiklerinizin hayatından veya daha büyük şeylerden vazgeçiyorsanız büyük bir motivasyonunuzun olması gerekiyor. Hikayedeki bu karakterin motivasyonu bana tatmin edici gelmedi açıkcası. Biraz yüzeysel hatta karikatür seviyesi geldi kötü karakterlerin motivasyonları.

Olumsuz bulduğum yönler genel olarak kitabın edebi yönüyle ilgili. Kitap edebi yönüyle ön plana çıkmıyor açıkcası.

Yazarın hayal gücünü çok beğendim. 2. kitabı da okuyacağım. Yer yer tempo problemi de olsa kitap çok güzel bağlanmış. Sonunu çok beğendim. Kitabın sonu bu kadar iyi bağlanmamış olsa 3 verirdim ancak şimdi 3.5’den 4 veriyorum. Edebi yönü zayıf olmasına rağmen hikaye anlatım tekniği ve yazarın yaratıcılığı bunu hak ediyor bence.

Bilimkurgu sevenlere tavsiye ederim. Keyifli bir eser.

"El tema del primer contacto humano con civilizaciones extraterrestres ha sido uno de los preferidos en la literatura de ciencia ficción, prácticamente desde que comenzó el género en los 1600.

¿Cómo serán ellos? ¿qué buscaran saber de nosotros? ¿qué tan avanzados seremos en comparación suya? ¿cómo nos encontrarán? ¿tendrán intenciones pacíficas o vendrán por nuestros recursos a cualquier costo?

Autores de todos los tipos han soñado y representado las respuestas a estas preguntas, desde Stanislav Lem hasta Isaac Asimov. Entre los científicos, destaca la ""solución"" soñada por Carl Sagan en su novela Contacto, una de las más conocidas en el género y que representa a una civilización hiperavanzada que ha creado un sistema de autopistas espaciotemporales que conectan toda la Galaxia y que, con intenciones pacíficas, revela el secreto de los viajes interestelares a los humanos.

La respuesta que propone Cixin en ""El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos"" ante la pregunta de qué hacer en caso de un contacto extraterrestre, es distinta a la de Sagan: ""¡No contesteis! ¡No contesteis! ¡No contesteis!"" O por lo menos no lo hagais en caso del contacto con una civilización como la trisolariana.

Cuatro cosas me han impresionado gratamente de la novela: 1) esta bellamente escrita, es agradable de leer y casi ""musical"" en algunos apartes; 2) el contexto cultural es único: la complicada revolución cultural China y el posterior desarrollo social, económico y científico del país (es bueno leer una novela en la que los protagonistas no son europeos o americanos y los que aparecen, que son de allí, deben intentar hablar en mandarín); 3) la increíble precisión científica de las descripciones en la novela, al punto que algunos apartes parecen más bien extraídos de un texto de mecánica celeste, física de partículas o radioastronomía; y 4) la fresca originalidad de la historia y todos sus detalles.

Es para mí indiscutible que esta novela (y las demás de la trilogía) pasarán a la historia de la ciencia ficción como unas de las mejores que se han escrito en el tema.

Más allá de ser un libro de ficción más, ""El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos"" es un excelente material de estudio para seminarios, cursos, clubes de revistas, o grupos de aficionados a la astrobiología.

"I struggled with this book to begin with for three reasons. Firstly there was my unfamiliarity with the details of the Cultural Revolution - like most Westerners I probably understood only the most superficial overview about what happened in China during the 1960s and 70s, and certainly wasn't aware of how awful it was to have to live with for individuals who were directly affected. If this book had only tackled this one element it would have been a worthy book to read.

My second issue is more personal, in that I always struggle with translated works, at least to begin with. This has nothing to do with the quality of the translation, more that I find that I can't get into the book because I am never sure whether it is a good translation of a bad book or a bad translation of a good book. Usually at some point in reading the book this feeling disappears as if I need to click some switch in my head before the translation becomes invisible.

The final reason is the only one in the end that I found insurmountable, and that was the fact that I simply could not keep the names of the characters straight in my head. Again, this has a lot to do with unfamiliarity of the Chinese naming system, but even with a list of characters I still was thinking Which character is that?"" well into the second half of the book, after which I just stop trying to remember who was who.

All this sounds like I didn't like the book which couldn't be further from the truth, because I really did enjoy it. I particularly liked the whole ""Three Body Problem"" computer game section, and the end part of the story where the elements all come together. Other parts felt less assured to me, possibly because I am never too happy when politics intrude on science fiction. Still, at times the book felt a little uneven in places to my mind. My issue with character names was possibly also as a result of the main characters not really standing out in my mind, with the possible exception of Da Shi, the Chinese policeman that somehow feels more like a Westerner with his crudeness of speech and way of tackling things simply and directly.

Still, this was an excellent book, well worth the read and setting up a story that can be explored in its sequels in more depth.

"La început m-a lovit confuzia datorată traducerilor succesive care au ajuns sa numeasca ""brigazi rosii"" ambele tabere beligerante, m-a lovit „trasul” cu arme de foc, dar si cu arme albe, m-a lovit legea lui „Om” și, in general, toate cazurile în care grupul de litere „oh” din interiorul cuvintelor a fost înlocuit cu „O”. Dar am considerat aceste aspecte de formă ca fiind minore, conținutul se anunța foarte profund.""
Apoi (după partea foarte bună despre revoluția culturală chineză și viața eroinei principale în baza militară) a început să devina ușor plicticoasa, însă latura științifică rămânea foarte faină.
Apoi am dat peste:
„Mâna lui Ye ezită la doi centimetri deasupra lui.
Destinul întregii rase umane depindea de aceste degete subțiri.
Fără ezitare, Ye apăsă pe buton
- Ce faci? întrebă unul dintre bărbați. încă somnoros.” Pag. 281, transcriere exactă.
Pe lângă asemenea exprimări, peste tot găsisem liniuțe de dialog puse aiurea, majuscule în plus și în minus, punctuație lipsă. Totuși, cartea rămânea bună, odată ce treceai peste formă.
Însă cu vreo o sută și ceva de pagini înainte de final, lectura s-a transformat în cădere liberă.
Am mai găsit încă o dată construcția:
„Degetele ascultătorului ezitară în aer deasupra butonului.
Destinul civilizației trisoliene depindea acum de aceste degete subțiri.
Fără ezitare, apăsă pe buton.” Deci dualitatea ezitară - fără ezitare era leitmotiv? Plus că, deodată, trisolisienii erau numiți „oameni”, ceea ce fusese evitat înainte.
Vreo cincizeci de pagini de făcut teoria protonului au fost chiar în plus, la fel și încercarea de a descrie societatea trisolisiană.
Finalul însă e decent, deși bazat pe extinderi științifice cumplite. În fine, am dat 3* totuși pentru partea istorică, pentru ideea strălucită a sistemului trisolisian… și cam atât.

"The Three-Body Problem is a Chinese science fiction thriller translated into English and follows several different scientists during different parts of their lives. First there's Ye Wenjie who witnesses her father getting beat to death in front of her during the Cultural Revolution and is then brought to a government base to work on a special project, under the eye of commanding officers and other scientists. Decades later, Wang Miao a nano-scientist is dragged into a strange police investigation which ends up with him involved in an online game where he tries to solves The Three-Body Problem and all the dots in the story so far begin to connect.

Okay, so this was good and I did actually enjoy reading it but there was just so.much.science and I was too stupid for it. I liked science in school and I went on to study chemistry and biology for my school exams but I do not like or understand science on this level and every single page was just saturated with it. In saying that, I could more or less get what was going on with the plot without actually understanding every single thing but I do feel like some of it did go over my head at times.

This was well paced, and despite the science jargon kept me hooked and wanting to keep reading. I really wanted to figure out what the hell was going on. Because this was originally Chinese, there were some bits I didn't quite understand (though the Translators Notes came in very handy at different point) but it was also very well translated and Ken Liu really kept the story flowing and engaging in English, as much as I can believe it is in its original Chinese. It was also great for me to read a book set in China and learning a lot about it as I went.

"This is hard SF and with that in mind, the ideas that Cixin explores are pretty mind bending, but as with a lot of hard SF the characters are a bit lacking. It may be an aspect of translation, or maybe it's something cultural, but there is a style of character dialog that is common to a lot of the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean media that I consume (I notice it in movies and anime as well as in books) in which the character awkwardly starts proclaiming a viewpoint in a stilted manner that seems disconnected from the rest of the conversation. Almost if if they are announcing, here I am, it's my turn to talk, here's my viewpoint. In this book it frequently feels like the characters are just sock puppets being used by the author to convey different ideologies.
Having a background in computer science, I was fascinated by the concept of having an army of people become a computer by each one acting as a single logic gate using flags, and of course I immediately thought about the nightmare it would be to write code and debug in such a system, let alone how computationally slow it would be, let alone the logistics of keeping the computer fed. And I almost forgot to mention the error rate. Not really feasible, but a fascinating concept anyway.
I loved the concept of unfolding a proton into lower dimensional spaces, and the series of incorrect unfolding was pretty awesome, and I also liked the way he used that to explain the seeming miraculous break down of physics from the viewpoint of earth scientists, and how that worked into the plot of the aliens.
So for me, this book succeeds because of the deeply speculative science, with an understanding that the characters are on the weak side. I liked it enough that I went ahead and bought the next book.

"Not at all the book I expected, but a thought-provoking, mind-bending science-fiction book.

I’ll begin by talking about the most unexpected thing: the importance of Three Body, a very realistic simulation-type video game. Every time it appeared, I couldn’t believe that I was reading about such a thing — and I found it such a weird contribution to the novel. I warmed up to it and even liked it after a while but at first I thought it was a waste of space.

Now I think it’s one of many bold creative decisions that the novel makes.

Also: I loved all the turns the setting takes. The fact that the reader is veering back and forth between the 21st century and China circa-1970 is really cool — and it’s even cooler that flashbacks are rarely used. The novel depends heavily on stories-within-stories, and I liked that a lot.

I also thought it was interesting that virtually every character in the book is an academic scientist. The tone of the storytelling reflects this, and it was a good decision: too many sci-fi books follow military- or political-type characters. The focus of this book on science goes over really well.

Lastly, I will note that this book is suspenseful. It’s a slow burn — it’s never boring, but it also never really speeds up. It’s more like an unraveling. It’s thankfully suspenseful the whole way through. But there were times, especially early in the book, where I thought it was aimless. I know now that is not true at all, and it’s a very well-crafted, well-told story, but this impression early on is probably my sole complaint about the book.

"This was an epic scifi, without any resemblance to anything which I had read before.
Later on, I came to know that this book belongs to a genre called as Hard Sci-fi.
I am not sure that I liked this book very much. My 4 stars rather denote the awe which I felt while reading this book.
It all starts innocuously in the 1960s with the Chinese cultural revolution wherein many intellectuals lost their lives, including Yenji 's father.
Yenji is a key figures in this book. So is Yang, a much younger physicist. There are other people too.
Gist of the story portrays different galaxies and their lifeforms and human beings trying to interact with aliens, and vice versa.
The aliens are of course hell bent upon conquering earth for their use as the world they live in, trisolaris has 3 suns which create havoc with their climate creating chaotic eras wherein the living beings have to dehydrate and lay in storage.
We are first introduced to Trisolaris by the way of video games..and only much later did I realise that there is close connection between gaming and reality.
This Magnum opera made me dither in rating it as I wanted to give only 3 stars for the pleasure I got in reading but was definitely worth more than 4 stars for the leap of imagination.

Why I read it?
Added to my to-be-read list seeing some reviews, and Manju, my constant BR buddy desired that we push it up our list and read it now.

"Bojuju s pokušením dát pět hvězd. Ale je to to trilogie - určitě to může být ještě lepší!

Tohle je staré dobré ""hard"" sci-fi. Zejména v závěru se vám hodí, pokud víte něco o fyzice a více dimenzích (jedenáct bude stačit ;-)

Co je na téhle knížce nové? Především, odehrává se v Číně. Začíná během a pomalu vás (pomocí vysvětlujících poznámek pod čarou) provede následným vývojem.

Název knihy jasně odkazuje, o co půjde. je klasickou úlohou nebeské (a později) kvantové mechaniky. Je to sci-fi, takže o tu nebeskou mechaniku samozřejmě půjde. Mimojiné.

Zajímavé je ale využití tohoto problému v herní mechanice počítačové hry. To je asi trend současné sci-fi - virtualizace, která klame tělem.

V čem jsem se trochu ztrácel, byla čínská jména. Proto oceňuji, že vydavatel přidal na začátek knihy seznam postav pro rychlou orientaci.

Další díl, , by měl vyjít v listopadu 2017. Už se moc těším.

"This is only 4.75 stars for me because I just can't brain the science-y stuff in the book. But don't get me wrong, the writer and translator did their best to explain everything but some parts are just too much for me. Too much information to absorb. Especially the last 10% of the book.

The Three-Body Problem is a fast-paced science fiction book that grasps your attention from the very first page. There's so much going on and the author did not sugarcoat any of the history. She showed us how brutal the Cultural Revolution was and how this chapter in history impacted the present-day in the book.

I like how the author explored the theme of humanity in the book. The good, the bad and the ugly. She showed us that when you push someone to their limits, they will lose hope in all of humanity and kickstart something that might doom all of humanity.

The twist was beyond my imagination and it definitely exceeded my expectations. I was baffled by how a single action can have such a ginormous effect. But I think that's the beauty of this book. How Cixin Liu masterfully planted clues throughout the book and masterfully weaved all the pieces together so when you finally get the full picture, it feels almost satisfying like you've cracked the master mode in a video game.

I can't wait to see how Netflix is going to adapt this book and I hope it will do justice to the book.

"I enjoyed all of the books on last year's Hugo Shortlist to varying degrees, so started working on this year's list. One of the shortlisted books is the third in a series, so I went back to the first one (this one) to start it. I never got into The Three-Body Problem.

could be painted in grays, shift styles (e.g., when the central character enters the video game via virtual reality suit), and is populated by people and aliens I don't care about. Most of the people have very little hope for the future – both related to the Cultural Revolution and, later in the book, as the aliens, apparently, attack science and scientists.

I kept trying to get into , as I'd read a review on Amazon suggesting that some readers might be turned off initially, but I'd gotten to 43% in the book and still wasn't there. Even as I write this non-review, I keep thinking of interesting aspects to the story. My overall reaction appears to be a minority reaction, however, at least from the small sample of raving reviews I read. If you like science geek science fiction (e.g., Neal Stephenson's Seveneves), you might enjoy this. If, like me, you want more characterization (e.g., Ann Leckie's Ancillary series), you might want to look elsewhere.

"3.5 es la nota real que le doy.

No voy a hacer una reseña muy amplia porque lo acabo de terminar y no aún tengo que colocarlo en la cabeza.

El libro se me ha hecho largo. Ale, ya lo he soltado y así de primeras... pero reconozco que tiene secciones entretenidas y sorprendentes.
Lo que más me gusta es la crítica sin tapujos a los humanos. El libro nos desnuda para dejarnos en evidencia con todas las virtudes al aire y a la vez nos habla, en cierto modo, de esperanza.
Lo que menos me gusta son sus personajes. Una cosa es ser plano, otra cosa ya es usar personajes excusa para contar una historia. Que vale que no hay protagonistas como tal... pero hombre, un poco de empatía , que a veces parece un libro de física (y es lo que yo estudié...)
La trama es entretenida y está bien llevada. Tiene un par de giros curiosos y me gusta que no se guarde demasiadas cosas para el resto de libros. Y sobre el texto como tal, muy bien escrito, nada me chirría.

El problema es que me falta emoción, y no hablo de escenas de acción, hablo de que me emocione. Que me remueva un poco, joe. Cada vez me pasa más que si un libro no me raspa en el pecho, ahí donde se bombea la sangre, no me atrapa... será que me estoy volviendo viejo y siento cada vez menos, no sé!

"Sasvim dobra SF priča, nedovršena naravno, deo je trilogije, u kojoj je zaokružena priča o prvom kontaktu ljudi i vanzemaljske kulture u vidu Trisolarijanaca ili bića koja dolaze sa planete sa tri zvezde, tri sunca. Je Venđije je signal u vidu poruke nekome usmerila direktno u sunce koje bi po njenom mišljenju taj signal trebalo da pojača i da ga u vidu moćne antene prosledi dalje i kosmos. I uspelo je, prvi kontakt je uspostavljen, zatim je došao i drugi i ubrzo je došlo do formiranja odbora za doček Trisolarijanaca, njihovih fanova, njihove religije koje čega. Napravljena je i simulacija u vidu videoigre koja objašnjava sve sa tri sunca i koja na kraju saopštava da će se dve civilizacije uskoro sresti.
Knjiga koja veoma lepo objašnjava kinesku kulturu, ali komunističku Kinu i dešavanja u okviru nje. Pored toga knjiga je pisana uz obilje naučnih termina što može da smeta jer je dosta nerazumljivo, ali se pisac potrudio da to lepo objasni.
Da li je u pitanju neprijateljska civilizacija, koji su njihovi planovi, zašto naučnici izvršavaju samoubistva, kakva je uloga dva protona i njihovih jedanaest dimenzija, kao i nanotehnologije u mogućem susretu civilizacija, šta su akceleratori i koji su eksperimenti u službi napretka ka mikrokosmosu? Nije uopšte loše akao uvod u trilogiju.

Esmu ļoti maz lasījusi grāmatas, kur darbība norisinās Ķīnā, vēl mazāk ķīniešu autoru sarakstītos darbus. Ķīna ar savu seno un bagāto kutlūru, cilvēku masām un tur valdošo komunismu man ir mistērija.

"If Isaac Asimov had read Peter Watts' books as a teenager, he might've written something like the Three-Body Problem. In many respects, TBP reads like a novel from the Golden Age of SF: the character development is pretty poor, but the premise and the plot are very engaging, plus the ""science"" part of the science fiction is very prominent.

But unlike Golden Age writers, Liu's work is dark and even depressing. There are no heroes here. There is a lot of despair and opportunism, but nothing really uplifting. If you liked , I'd expect you'll enjoy TBP as well, since they share a certain mood. They are both first-contact stories, where the contact isn't really something to be celebrated. They both have a rather low opinion on humanity. They both leave you staring into nothingness for a while after setting them down.

"Review after 2nd read:

It's undoubtedly original, and full of big ideas. But I couldn't get into the writing style, or overlook the many scientific flaws.

I was fairly lukewarm after the first read as well, but I didn't trust my own opinion. The book won the Hugo Award, after all. And I have been in awe of Ken Liu's writing in his own original stories, so I didn't quite understand how his translation can feel so stiff here. Or how so many readers could be happy with flat characters and clunky plot devices. After reading the full trilogy, though, I finally understand. A lot of the love for this book can be explained by the novel cultural perspective (novel for the US audience, that is), the parade of creative and innovative ideas, and some halo effect from the (undisputably better) 2nd and 3rd volumes in the series. I can respect all of those reasons now, even if the execution still presents a barrier for me.

Even though I didn't quite enjoy it, the book actually does reward a re-read. It is littered with cryptic statements that just seem confusing on the first pass, and only make sense after knowing all of the various reveals.

"No suelo leer CF, aunque poco a poco le voy poniendo remedio. Cuando un alumno chino me regaló este libro, me quedé sorprendidísima: me cayó el cielo. En la China profunda, conseguir libros en idiomas que no sean mandarín es tarea de titanes. Así que me puse a leer con ganas y reconozco que, al principio, me costó bastante engancharme. No es que la historia china no sea fascinante, era que no me lo esperaba... ¿dónde están los aliens?, me preguntaba yo, ¿cuándo aparecen?
Jesús, qué tonta. ""Aparecen"", claro, mucho más tarde.
Hacia la mitad del libro, sí estaba engachada. Me parecía que todo estaba explicado de una manera increíble, ¡era tan verosímil que me moría de miedo! (pa quien no sepa nada de física, como una servidora).
Por lo tanto, sí recomiendo a los fans del género y también a la gente a la que le gusten los videojuegos. Pero reconozco que leer acerca de cosas que me son tan alienígenas (ayyy, chiste malo, sorry :_) hizo que me costase bastante prestar la atención debida y entender bien la trama.

"I was really excited about this book but I made it like 30 pages in before deciding it is just really not for me. Three major strikes against it:
1. Weird fetishization of a teenage girl getting murdered, in the very opening scene. ""Her fifteen year old body was so soft that the bullet hardly slowed down as it passed through it"", ""half her young head was blown away and only a single, beautiful eye remained"" -- nope.
2. Middle aged physicist dude who is The Only One Smart And Special Enough To Not Fall For The Revolutionary Propaganda, including his Dumb Wife (""her fragile mind, hanging on only by a thin thread""). I was getting John Galt speech flashbacks during the ""struggle session"".
3. Constant POV shifts, like, every other sentence. I saw Ken Liu defending this practice (""head-hopping"") in an io9 interview recently, and I guess it's a matter of taste, but I just can't help but associate it with the dregs of fanfiction.net.

"Po letech a znovupřečtení (respektive poslechu) přidávám hvězdičku a kaji se za první průměrné hodnocení. Tentokrát jsem zvolila audioverzi, kterou tímto vřele doporučuji.

Problém tří těles je výrazně technické sci-fi, ve kterém je kladen větší důraz na technické reálie a vědecký prvek, než na psychologii hlavních postav. Protože nemám dost zkušeností s čínskou literaturou, netroufám si říct, jestli placatost postav je způsobena kulturním prostředím, povahou Liu Cixina, nebo to byl plánovaný záměr.

Zajímavé je že, tady mi absence charakteru nevadila. Autor má úžasný, pro Evropany možná trochu neobvyklý vypravěčský dar a specifický, emočně vyprázdněný styl.
Nicméně ho trochu podezřívám, že to zkrátka má v povaze, jinak by těžko mohl schvalovat (resp. normalizovat) perzekuce Ujgurů čínským totalitním režimem. Což je také důvod, proč Netflix prozatím zastavil práce na seriálu na motivy jeho knih.

"I probably am not being fair to this book, because so many things about it worked, and it was brimming with 'things'.

It's an international thriller, set in communist China. That worked

Its a personal drama about a womans struggle to work in science, to be allowed to follow her own path career-wise and suffering betrayal after betrayal, and how she deals with it. That worked too

Its a mystery, trying to put the various story lines together. That mostly worked.

It is part political intrigue, with factions building up in regard to how to respond to the Three Body Problem.

It's an alien invasion story, filled with angst due to all the unknown factors of what the aliens even want or need.

and there is a virtual reality game within the pages of the book. That worked at first, but in the end made little sense...

"This was a very engaging read. The mystery is set up really well. The reveal is a little bit hand-wavy but at least the author tried really hard to keep to the science.

The beginning has a lot of Chinese and Communist politics which bored me. But the author does a good job foreshadowing and feeding bits of the mystery little by little to draw in the reader.

I like that the message of the book is pro-science.
Though the book does have a strong theme of conspiracy theory which is usually a turn off.

The most fascinating part of the book is the planet with three stars in its system. Its orbit is chaotic so life on the planet has to adapt to extreme and often sudden shifts in climate. This world was imagined very carefully and really felt authentic.

"So....the first thing to say is I am not normally a Science Fiction reader but this year I decided I would at least attempt one novel in this genre. This series had outstanding reviews and also intrigued me by being a Chinese novel in translation. I am not convinced it is a great starting point for the novice reader to SF. However, I persevered. There are certainly some very readable passages and some exciting drama but there is an awful lot of this ""The etching of micro integrated circuits can only occur at the macro scale, and only on a macroscopic two-dimensional plane. Thus we must unfold a proton into two dimensions."" Pages and pages of theoretical and fantastical Quantum mechanics ....I can see the appeal of the rather unique take on a first contact story but the effort to extract it is just to much for this reader.

I can't fathom the fact that someone was able to come up with this concept and put it into this wonderful novel. The Three-Body Problem has been talked about a lot but in my opinion still not enough; I still meet people who have not heard of this series despite it's upcoming tv series adaptation.

Above is how my brain feels about this book. This book is an absolute feat of imagination and storytelling. The analogies used to explain complex physics problems were astounding, and the non-linear storytelling kept me intrigued throughout. It was a particular delight on audiobook.

I don’t even know where to start!!!!



“By the time you’re my age, you’ll realize that everything you once thought mattered so much turns out to mean very little.”

I watched the show first, actually not knowing that it was a book. I saw several people saying very different things on if watching the show first was better or if reading the book first was the way to go. Obviously only speaking for myself here, and this isn’t usually the order I like to do things in, but this time I’m really glad I did watch it first.

First off I have to give props where props are due; Netflix took a lot of liberties with making some big changes from page to screen and I liked the choices they made. I’m a sci-fi girl, but I’m not even going to lie, if I hadn’t seen the show first there would have been several moments reading the book where I would have been lost.



This is a book I could easily see re-reading and every single time getting so many new things out of it. I ended up liking how much physics was in this, even though again, some of it did go over my head, and I did have to look a few things up to fully feel immersed.
(I don’t mind having to google what something is because then I feel like I’m really taking something away from a story after reading it.)

I think reading this gave me all the little missing pieces I didn’t get from the show. If you’re a visual learner the show is probably going to be the best form of media to take this in. In the show the nanofiber aspect was my favorite part and the episode you actually get to see it work was my favorite of the whole season (). Where in the book I felt it being used wasn’t as in depth as I would have liked. This goes for several other moments in the book as well. Having the visual ads just really worked.

will 100% not be for everyone. And to me I think it works better on screen than it does in print, but I still really enjoyed this.

I think the themes and topics in this book could easily fit more modern things happening in the word right now like climate change. How some things that might not truly be affecting the here and now will massively impact the people living in 500 years.

Even with my above statement I would recommend this novel to others, because if you are like me, when you finish this you’ll end up in a deep internet dive.

"El problema de los tres cuerpos no es para todos, pero fue para mí.


Este libro es complejo de describir, considero que la sinopsis que da Goodreads del libro es rara y no representa al libro correctamente, aquí está con algunos cambios:



Las primeras páginas son ambiguas, no sabes qué está pasando y adonde quiere llevarte la trama. Te introduce a un personaje en medio de la revolución cultural china, luego da un salto de 40 años al futuro, cambiando a otra perspectiva, cuando todavía no queda muy claro qué pasa con el personaje inicial. Sin embargo, si te sumerges en la trama y te ganas al libro lentamente vale completamente la pena.

El estilo de Liu Cixin en este libro va muy centrado en la ciencia, las ideas y los conceptos. En este aspecto se asemeja bastante a Asimov en el enfoque que quiere dar a su historia, Grandes ideas antes que personajes. Su estilo de escritura es lo contrario a elegante y sutil. Prefiere contar antes que mostrar, algo que normalmente es considerado como un pecado capital a la hora de contar historias. Creo que este es el punto principal que puede dividir a los lectores de este libro ¿Estás dispuesto a sacrificar la prosa y personajes a cambio de leer ideas extremadamente originales?

Yo estuve dispuesto y el libro me dio conceptos de la astrodinámica como el problema de los tres cuerpos, me lanzó ideas filosóficas acerca de si la humanidad debe ser salvada o no mezclado con un subtexto de las atrocidades ocurridas en la revolución cultural china. Me contó acerca de un mundo virtual donde se mezclan culturas, la historia y el avance científico humano. Valió la pena cada segundo.

Esto es lo que brilla en este libro, la manera en la que el autor trata sus ideas es espectacular y en mi experiencia eclipsó completamente los fallos. A pesar de la escritura me pude imaginar cada escenario a la perfección (y vaya que hay escenas visualmente increíbles). En el libro se respira el amor por la ciencia y sus posibilidades. Tiene ideas originales y aterradoras a partes iguales. Tiene una historia intrigante en todo momento, quería saber qué estaba pasando y ahora quiero saber qué pasará en los siguientes libros. Porque esto es solo la punta del iceberg, es solamente un preludio. Espero que los siguientes libros no me decepcionen.

"Il titolo del libro fa riferimento a una classe di problemi della dinamica di base relativi alla meccanica classica. In sostanza, data la posizione iniziale, la massa e la velocità di tre corpi (pianeti) che sono soggetti all’influsso della reciproca attrazione gravitazionale, si noterà che il comportamento del sistema da essi costituito è caotico e imprevedibile.



Avevo idea che il titolo si riferisse a una roba del genere? Assolutamente no. Mi sono posta il problema dopo tipo metà libro. Mi sono sentita proprio sveglia *ironia*.
Ma aspettate, non finisce qui, perché il titolo fa anche riferimento a un videogioco fondamentale all’interno della storia. E qui, come in altre parti del libro, ci sono alcuni punti che ho trovato davvero mindblowing.
Ci spostiamo tra passato (si inizia con gli anni della rivoluzione culturale; ammetto la mia ignoranza sulla Storia cinese, ma di base sono rimasta sbalordita dalla violenza e dall’assurdità delle accuse con cui hanno ucciso – o istigato al suicidio – tantissime menti brillanti, di qualsiasi disciplina. Davvero terribile. E poi era una società in cui non ci si poteva fidare di nessuno; penso che vivere così sia davvero stressante e sconfortante, oltre al fatto che ti costringe a vivere in un costante stato di ansia e paura) e presente.
È un libro che ti fa essere un lettore attivo, ti porta a cercare informazioni, ad approfondire, e mi piace sempre molto quando una storia riesce a fare ciò.
Ero spaventata dal contenuto, perché da quello che ho sentito da diverse persone che l’avevano letto, sembrava quasi incomprensibile. Secondo me invece è assolutamente fattibile. Il libro è chiaro e se si è curiosi o si ha la necessità di approfondire qualche passaggio, basta dare un’occhiata in internet. Io ho fatto così e non ho avuto nessun problema.
L’aspetto fantascientifico l’ho trovato molto affascinante. Alcuni aspetti mi hanno ricordato il mondo di Dune (penso soprattutto alle descrizioni dell’ambiente nell’Era del Caos – decisamente ostile – e alla conseguente disidratazione e successiva reidratazione), mentre per altri mi ha ricordato Murakami: il mistero, le morti, il fatto che tutto sia collegato e legato a qualcosa di più grande, le vite dei personaggi che si intrecciano, la tragedia che aleggia nello spirito e nelle menti.



Cosa non mi ha convinto: la caratterizzazione dei personaggi pressoché inesistente – ora come ora potrebbero pure morire tutti, non mi interesserebbe più di tanto – e alcuni comportamenti, da parti di scienziati, che non hanno nessun senso. Come ti viene in mente, così dal nulla, che degli alieni possano – e vogliano – aiutarci a vivere meglio? Perché dovrebbero farlo? Perché non dovrebbero semplicemente conquistarci? Lo trovo un comportamento davvero stupido – e incoerente – per delle menti così brillanti, non me lo spiego proprio.
Per il resto mi è piaciuto davvero molto e non vedo l’ora di continuare col secondo volume.

"I'm struggling to write a cohesive review on this, but let me at least point out a few things I liked about it. I will start off by saying the ending made me really happy, and I think you should finish the book!

The first third was slooow, so you do have to give it a chance. I also really like character driven books so once again, I had to give the book a chance because the characters are relatively meaningless in this book. Shi Qiang (the policeman) was an exception who I thoroughly enjoyed.

I loved the whole unfolding of the three body problem in the game. I really enjoyed the reveal of the reason behind the Stable and Chaotic Periods, and how the Trisolarans gradually learned the significance of the ""flying stars"". The whole Sophons project was cool. I'm not educated specifically enough to comment on the legitimacy of the physics involved in this book, but I enjoyed those themes immensely, nonetheless. It was honestly what carried me through the second third of the book.

I took great delight in Von Neumann's human motherboard.

Earth vs. Extraterrestrials is an age-old sci-fi theme, but this was a really, really nice take on it that felt fresh. (A hard feeling to achieve in sci-fi)

The last third of this book was great!!!!! I like plots that make you rethink the value, and values, of humanity, and it's one of my #1 reasons I like sci-fi. This book really brought that. The closing, (bugs!) was, I thought, perfect.

P.S. The author's afterword was well worth reading

"Diversity and giving space to voices other than those of the privileged majority have been a huge talking point in SFF in the past year. One way to achieve this is through translating foreign-language titles into English and to introduce these new perspectives to English-speaking readers. Yet this is still a very rare occurrence, as few foreign-language titles are translated and published each year. Off the top of my head the only authors I can think of in speculative fiction are Haruki Murakami, Carlos Ruiz Zafon, Pierre Pevel, and Pasi Ilmari Jääskeläinen, and of course, Thomas Oldeheuvelt’s series that will be published in English in the autumn of next year. So  it was really exciting to see this novel brought to print in English by Tor. It’s the first Chinese SFF series ever to have been brought over, at least by one of the big Five, as far as I’m aware. This is exciting because China is one of the biggest and fastest-developing countries in the world, where there is some great voices we’ve never heard of and we finally get to discover one of them. Liu Cixin is one of the best-known and most successful SF writers in China, so his being the first to be translated into English isn’t actually that surprising.

is set in China, partially during the years of the Cultural Revolution and partially in the book’s present. As China developed along far different lines than Western culture – the most obvious being moving from a monarchy system to communism, instead of capitalism, and having what is essentially an oligarchy instead of a democracy for a long time – its cultural outlook and values are different from the familiar ones we usually encounter and I really enjoyed discovering these differences. I did need to quickly look up some of the background – Wikipedia for the win –  as it has been a long time since I learned about the Cultural Revolution in secondary school. It also made the way Liu CIxin treated the Western scientists and philosophers who show up in the Trisolaris sections awesome, because they were so irreverent, lacking the gravitas they’d usually be embodied with in Western literature.

In-between the past and present storylines, Liu Cixin introduces us to a world called Trisolaris, which as the name indicates is a world with three suns. The titular three body problem stems from these three solar bodies and their effect on the planet and to be honest this part just went right over my head somewhat, because science, but it didn’t do it in such a way that I felt dumb or lost. In the context of the Three Body computer game and the way the problem was explained there, I could kind of squint and understand it. Enough to be going on with anyway. The game mechanics Liu Cixin uses to explain the Trisolaran quandary and its society and culture was fantastic, especially as gamification is something that is a technique that’s used in teaching and literacy instruction as well and so it is actually something quite familiar.

In addition to the hard physics of the three body problem, there is also a lot of technical and mechanical science in play between the computers and telescopes that are used at some key points of the novel and let’s not forget all the stuff the military brings to bear. Yet when we set the science (fictional) elements aside, the core of the book is essentially a mystery, including murders and conspiracies, which Wang Miao and Shi Qiang need to solve. I loved these two characters. Wang is our main point of view, be it in our world or that of Three Body, and he is such a calm, methodical thinker, testing and retesting his theories, but one forced out of his usual habits through the events described in the story. Shi Qiang, or Da Shi as he’s nicknamed, is his polar opposite almost: worldly, impulsive, and always in edge, he’s a great foil for Wang. The other main viewpoint character, the one through whose eyes we get most of the story set in the past is Ye Wenjie. The daughter of an intellectual executed during the Cultural Revolution, she’s a very sympathetic character. However, she doesn’t come through her experiences unscathed and the way Liu Cixin develops her and changes how the reader sees her over the course of the novel was brilliant. She goes for sympathetic, to eerie, to scary in the space of a book.

One aspect of the story that has to be mentioned is its translation. I often translate web texts for work and that just plain, vanilla Dutch-to-English, without literary flourishes, but it can be quite challenging at times, especially if there is a specific sense I want to convey for which there is no direct English equivalent. So, having heard Ken Liu talk about translating on the and the issues he encountered, I can only imagine how hard it must have been to translate this novel and do Liu Cixin’s prose justice. In my opinion, he has done a marvellous job with this first book in the series. The writing is gorgeous and sometimes lyrical, yet hard and clinical in the places where it needs to be and I never had the sense that this was a translated text. I also loved the translator’s notes Ken Liu included, especially as he didn’t just explain some of the Chinese cultural elements Western readers might not understand, he also touched upon some science elements. At one point, he even referenced an academic journal article, which I thought was very cool.

is a fantastic book. I loved this story with its old-time SF sensibilities, real, scary aliens – you guys, the aliens! – mixed with modern tech. I want to know what happens next and how Earth will react to the news that “they” are truly out there. It is easy to see why Liu Cixin is so popular in China and I can only hope he’ll be just as popular in the rest of the world now his work has been translated to English. If you want a hard SF novel, mixed with history and social science elements, than I can’t recommend highly enough. It’s one of my favourite novels of the year and it will definitely feature on my Favourites of 2014 list in a week or two.

"Soy principiante en la literatura de ciencia ficción y este libro me dio una buena arrastrada, pero fue de las buenas arrastradas, quedé con un gran sabor de boca al terminar este libro y es que es todo un viaje que al inicio no sabía a donde se iba a dirigir, si tiene muchas cosas de física y número además de ciertos eventos históricos chinos que como lectores occidentales desconocemos, sugiero siempre tener acceso a internet para hacer las investigaciones necesarias y aproveches más la lectura.

A través de varios puntos de vista vemos el avance tecnológico de la humanidad y como las ambiciones van creciendo, a la par de como varios científicos e intelectuales están suicidándose porque la ciencia ya no tiene sentido, así que se tendrá que investigar que es lo que esta pasando.

No quiero contar de más de este libro porque creo que es muy interesante descubrir la trama y lo que se desarrolla así sin conocimiento previo, es parte de la experiencia, solo diré que me gustó como se desarrolló todo y ya quiero leerme las siguientes novelas.

Puede ser algo cansado de leer al inicio por lo de los temas de física etc, pero una vez que le agarras el gusto todo se vuelve muy rápido y te picas hasta que lo terminas.

"Ufff ufff ufff ...🤷 Onomatopeya internacional desde aquí a Pekin (donde transcurre por cierto la historia).

No soy mucho de explayarme con mis opiniones de los libros, pero en este caso creo que haré una excepción. Sin spoilers (si es que total de la mitad es ficción inventada mía, para que engañar).

Es un libro que he dejado 3 veces sino más por falta de entendimiento, más mil veces que he tenido que repetir capítulos o volver hacia atrás para ""comprender"" al menos la base de la historia. La base es muy original, pero a mí particularmente me he sentido muy limitado en conocimiento de aspectos científicos. ¿Es para todo el mundo...? Juzguen ustedes mismos, yo por orgullo lo intenté y su continuación ya me la contáis vosotros !! Yo me rindo.

Ahora tengo curiosidad de ver serie a ver si me puede acabar de complementar y entender un poco más su historia... o por lo contrario liarme del todo 🤣🥳🤷

"Before the pandemic, a man at my face to face book club raved about this. He made it sound so good I put it on my over-burdened wish list. When a science fiction task came up this season I knew I finally had to try it. I say ""try it"" because I am not normally a science fiction reader.

The Three-Body is presented in two ways. First, it is a video game. I don't play that sort of computer game and the idea of having to don a haptic suit (I had to look up haptic) seems ridiculous to me. Anyway, the ""three body"" is a planet that has 3 suns, that they function randomly, so that the climate of the planet is sometimes too hot, sometimes too cold, rarely just right. Second, the three body is presented as a real planet called Trisolaris. An inter space communication is received.

Just above the Goodreads review box is ""What did you think?"" I know I am an outlier as, as of today, this has an average rating of 4.09 with over 351,000 ratings. I think I should have skipped it, but I was too stubborn to set it aside. I know I've read a translation, but I think it is not well-written. I think fiction should not need footnotes. I think there is too much science. I think the premise of some of the characters that humanity is a failed species and should be eliminated is so awful that I began to read only 10-15 pages at a time because that was all I could tolerate at one sitting.

Sometimes I write in my review that the stars I have awarded might be an exaggeration. I feel as if 1-star for this is an exaggeration.

Wow what can I say! Im not the worlds biggest sci-fi fan nor do I claim to have good science knowledge but holy crap this book was fantastic! 90-95% of the science went over my head but the characters and the story were so brilliant!

If you think the science would be too much, please try this book!

The struggles of humanity were so real and you really got sucked in to every aspect of the story! This book made me do science homework for the first time in roughly 16 years when I looked up exactly what the three body problem was (still not exactly sure) and looked up other solar systems so I could have a slightly better understanding! Thats impressive as I didn’t like doing science homework when I had too!

Overall, fantastic book, everyone should try this and I will be moving on to the sequels very soon.

"Oh wow, this is some big-brain and higher-level thinking going on with this book. I find theoretical physics to be incredibly interesting and the way these concepts were integrated into the storyline and used to develop the plot. Now I can't say that I fully understood everything about the physics that was discussed, but I got enough to be able to follow the plot. This is probably one of the most innovative and unique concepts I have seen for a sci-fi novel in quite some time, so I can clearly see why it has won such prestigious awards. It did take me a while to fully grasp everything that was going on with the storyline, but once I crossed the halfway point there was just plot revelation after plot revelation that had me completely hooked and my mind was blown.

"No soy lector de ciencia ficción. No, al menos, lo que se entiende como lector habitual por lo tanto estoy muy lejos de ser nada ni remotamente parecido a un experto en el tema. Aclaro esto para que entiendan dos cosas de la reseña que están por leer: primero, la ausencia casi total de referencias y segundo su condición de advertencia más que de análisis.

La advertencia es la siguiente: la novela que nos ocupa es la primera parte de una trilogía que trata ese tema clásico que es la invasión extraterrestre.

Convendrán conmigo en que eso está muy bien. Nada como unos extraterrestres y un buen puñado de naves espaciales para la noche del viernes.

Ocurre que ese es el tema de la trilogía, no de esta novela. No completamente, al menos. Esta primera parte es una introducción. Una larga, larga introducción. Larga y a ratos pesada. Pesadísima. A ratos, insisto. Qué demonios: una cosa infame que estuve a un tris de tirar tres veces por el balcón. Suerte que no tengo tal. PERO (ya verán qué gracioso) pese a los inconvenientes y las quejas y las manifestaciones públicas de indignación, el resultado, esto es, la valoración final es positiva.

Ya, yo tampoco lo entiendo.

He leído por ahí que su condición china juega en su contra, que no estamos acostumbrados, que es otra cosa, otro estilo, otra cadencia. Qué sé yo. Bobadas. Qué tendrá que ver el aburrimiento con la nacionalidad. Lo peleón del asunto es, por un lado, su condición de novela hard, esto es, mucha física, mucha teoría, mucha puesta en escena, pese a ocultarla tras muchas líneas de diálogo y una especie de búsqueda del tesoro mal desarrollada. Todo cansa y en esta novela acaba uno las más de las veces un poco harto de tanta explicación:

«No es nada complicado: como solo necesita una precisión del uno por ciento, bastará con que usemos datos del explorador del fondo cósmico COBE. —La doctora Sha empezó a teclear furiosamente ante el terminal correspondiente. De repente, apareció en él una línea verde—. Esta curva es una medición en tiempo real del fondo cósmico de microondas. En realidad, es más apropiado hablar de línea más que de curva... La temperatura es de 2.726±0,010K. El margen de error se debe al efecto Doppler del movimiento de la Vía Láctea, que ya ha sido filtrado. Si el tipo de fluctuación que usted espera observar (superior al uno por ciento) se da realmente, esta línea se volverá roja y pasará a ser un gráfico de ondas. Personalmente, apuesto a que seguirá siendo una línea verde hasta el fin de los tiempos; si espera una fluctuación observable a simple vista, me temo que tendrá que esperar hasta la extinción del Sol...»

Y luego está lo de ser ceremonia de la confusión. Personajes, tramas, subtramas, ires y venires, la vida de este, del otro, y un videojuego que obliga a aceptar pulpo como animal de compañía y que aburre a los muertos. Ya lo he dicho.

Mejor les cuento de qué va y así también me hago entender.

Hubo un tiempo en el que en China corrían malos tiempos para la física. Mataron a un señor que era físico y listo, que es una cosa que no siempre se da en la naturaleza. Su hija, marcada de por vida por tan triste acontecimiento, decide dedicar su vida un poco a lo mismo pero no hay modo: etiquetada como sospechosa habitual no logra prosperar en el mundillo de los gafapastas. Eso hasta que la meten voluntariamente y de por vida en una casita en el bosque, justo debajo de una enorme antena. Entonces demuestra ser más lista que el ajo: un día toca un botón.

Por otro lado, un hombre sigue una pista que le llevará a la mujer anterior por un camino sembrado de señales varias. La primera de ellas tiene un trágico origen: los científicos del planeta se están suicidando: la física no existe, dicen ellos, existencialistas perdidos. Eso es un drama, se ve, de ahí la investigación que llevará a nuestro héroe a descubrir un videojuego de realidad virtual. En el juego viajará a un planeta acosado por tres soles con trayectorias que, de puro irregulares, condenan a la humanidad a prácticamente extinguirse una y otra vez mientras tratan de encontrar la fórmula matemática que desvele los misterios del universo, o, cuando menos, les diga porque lado se pondrá el sol esa semana. Son los Trisolarianos. Los trisolarianos son unos señores que lo mismo se desecan que se esponjan y que están un poco bastante hartos de su planeta de mierda, que si unos días calor que si otros frío, que si esto no hay aire acondicionado que lo aguante.

La novela es confusa, irregular, aburrida unas veces, apasionante otras, pero en general es de ley reconocer que cuenta una historia interesante, imaginativa y prometedora, razón por la cual no dejaremos pasar su continuación. Cierto: lo hace tomándose un tiempo que sin duda hubiésemos agradecido más breve en según qué momentos, pero que no deja de ganarse el respeto precisamente por ese voluntario alejamiento de lo fácil, por ese sentar unas bases sólidas que, espero, se justifiquen en próximas entregas.

Mención especial para Javier Altayó, que ha tenido que vérselas con un chino de mucho cuidado. Desde aquí nuestros respetos y reconocimiento a una valía que, toda vez que de chino no tenemos ni pajolera idea, vamos a suponer ejemplar. He visto que tiene web y que comenta cosas de la novela: por si les interesa profundizar en el asunto:

"The premise here is very cool, but the execution is dry. Often, this is an issue I have with translated works - I can't tell if the writing is dry or if it's the translation that has not given enough life to the words. The science is also SO heavy-handed. It's hard for me to NOT compare it to the Netflix show, since I watched that first, which made a lot of these concepts really accessible. While I do want to know what happens next, the thought of having to read another book in the series like this one unfortunately does not excite me.

"Ολόκληρη η κριτική στο Smassing Culture

Το Πρόβλημα των Τριών Σωμάτων: Πολιτική, επιστήμη και η περατότητα της ανθρωπότητας

Η επιστημονική φαντασία, τουλάχιστον στην μοντερνιστική εκδοχή της, ήταν, στην πλειοψηφία της, ένα αισιόδοξο είδος. Ακόμα και όταν ανθρωπότητα βασανιζόταν σε πυρηνικές ερήμους ή σε απόμακρους πλανήτες, κατάφερνε με σκληρή δουλειά, λογική και θάρρος όχι μόνο να επιβιώσει αλλά και να επαναφέρει (ή να δημιουργήσει) έναν πολιτισμό.

Δεχόμενη σαν δεδομένο ότι η ανθρώπινη διάννοια μπορεί να βρει τη λύση στα πάντα καιπιστεύοντας ότι ο θεός δεν παίζει ζάρια σε ένα άπειρο σύμπαν, η μοντέρνα επιστημονική φαντασία μας έχει τροφοδοτήσει με μερικές από τις καλύτερες ιστορίες που έχουμε ακούσει ποτέ. Το Πρόβλημα των Τριών Σωμάτων του Κινέζου Liu Cixin, (στα ελληνικά από τις εκδόσεις SEΛΙΝΙ) το μοναδικό μεταφρασμένο βιβλίο που κέρδισε βραβείο Hugo στην ιστορία του θεσμού, είναι σίγουρα μια από τις καλύτερες αυτής της μακράς παράδοσης.

Περισσότερο επιστήμη παρά φαντασία, ο Liu Cixin θέτει στον πυρήνα της σκέψης του ένα παράδοξο: ενώ πιστεύει στην δύναμη του ανθρώπου να ξεπεράσει τις δυσκολίες, βάζει ως προμετωπίδα, ήδη από τον τίτλο, ένα άλυτο μαθηματικό πρόβλημα. Κάνοντας λοιπόν ένα βήμα πίσω, ο Cixin δεν τρέχει χαρούμενος προς ένα μέλλον τύπου Star Trek, όπου η ανθρωπότητα, συνεργατικά, κατακτά τα αστέρια. Αντίθετα, σεβόμενος την επιστημονική σκέψη, ίσως σε βαθμό λατρείας, θέτει αν όχι όρια, τότε σίγουρα προβληματισμούς. Αυτό ισχύει και για την πολιτική αλλά και για τ��ν ίδια την ανθρωπότητα.

Στο πολιτικό κομμάτι, ο Cixin παλεύει με την κληρονομιά της Κίνας, κυρίως αυτή της Πολιτιστικής Επανάστασης του Προέδρου Μάο. Κινούμενος σε ένα αντιδραστικό περιβάλλον νομενκλατούρας και αποθέωσης των επιστημόνων, ταυτόχρονα με μια διακριτική αλλά παρούσα υποτίμιση των κατώτερων μορφωτικά στρωμάτων, ο Cixin δεν μασάει τα λόγια του και καταφέρεται ανοικτά εναντίον του κομμουνιστικού παρελθόντος της Κίνας. Παρομοιάζοντας την πολύπλοκη διαδικασία της Πολιτιστικής Επανάστασης σαν μια μαζική εκκαθάριση ανθρώπων και περιβάλλοντος ο Cixin χάνει την επαφή του με το πρόσφατο παρελθόν και αναζητά μια κινέζικη ταυτότητα στο υπερτεχνολογικοποιημένο παρόν ή στο αρχαίο παρελθόν, χάνοντας όμως το συνδετικό τους κρίκο, τις κινήσεις που μετέτρεψαν μια αγροτική Κίνα σε τεχνολογική υπερδύναμη. Ταυτόχρονα, το κομμάτι της εργασίας, ποιος παράγει και εκμευταλεύεται τελικά αυτόν τον πλούτο μένει ασαφές. Αυτό είναι το χαρακτηριστικό του βιβλίου που μπορεί πολύ εύκολα να του εξασφαλίσει μια μνεία από τον Ομπάμα, αλλά πολύ δύσκολο στέκει ρε μια κριτική με βάση την πολιτική οικονομία ή ακόμα και την κοινή λογική…

Συγχρόνως, η αντίληψη του Cixin για την πρόοδο και την επιστήμη φαίνεται πως είναι πολύ μονοδιάσταση, εγκλωβισμένη ακόμα σε εναν μονοδιάσταστο, γραμμικό ντεντερμινισμό. Η εποχή του Χαλκού για διαδέχεται για πάντα την λίθινη, ενώ της Ατομικής θα έπεται πάντα αυτή της Πληροφορίας, απλοποιώντας πάρα πολύ την ιστορική και οικονομική διαδικασία την οποία ακολουθούν οι ανθρώπινες κοινωνίες. Ταυτόχρονα, για βιβλίο που ασχολείται με την φαντασία για την επιστήμη και την ζωή στους άλλους πλανήτες, εξακολουθεί να επιμένει φανατικά στον ανθρωποκεντρισμό των άστρικών μορφών ζωής…

Ωστόσο το βιβλίο του Cixin είναι ανάξιο λόγου επειδή καταφέρεται ενάντια στο κομμουνιστικό παρελθόν της χώρας του ή επειδή τελικά το κομμάτι της φαντασίας υπολείπεται αυτό της επιστήμης; Σε καμία περίπτωση. Ο συγγραφέας καταφέρνει, με πολύ λεπτομέρεια να δομήσει ένα μυστήριο, με καθαρά αστυνομική βάση, και να το διανθίσει σταδιακά με υψηλού επιπέδου επιστημονικό λεξιλόγιο και μεθοδολογία. Λεπτολόγος και μεθοδικός, δημιουργεί ένα κουβάρι χωρίς κενά και ασάφειες, συνδυάζοντας τους καλοφτιαγμένους, πολυεπίπεδους χαρακτήρες του (και τους οριακά μπεκετικούς διαλόγους που ανταλλάζουν) με μια οπτική που συνδυάζει ελπίδα και απογοήτευση για το μέλλον της ανθρωπότητας, ως σύνολο πια.

Το κινέζικο αυτό μυθιστόρημα καταφέρνει να απορροφά τον αναγνώστη αρχικά με την ιστορία του, ωστόσο, όσο προχωρά, παρά τις αδυναμίες που αναφέραμε λίγο πιο πάνω, θέματα για την πολιτική κατάσταση σε ένα μεταμοντέρνο σήμερα αρχίζουν και γίνονται κυρίαρχα. Oι ασταθείς πολιτικές συμμαχίες, η θεολογί�� που αναπτύσσεται τόσο γύρω από μεγάλα ιδεώδη όσο και από ακατανόητες πρακτικές ή την ίδια την επιστήμη, έρχονται στο προσκήνιο και σταδιακά αποκτούν πρωταγωνιστικό ρόλο. Επιπλέον, ως συνέχεια αυτών, το βιβλίο επιμένει, σε μεγάλο βαθμό, στην δύναμη της αλήθειας, την οποία μάλιστα ταυτίζει με την σωτηρεία της ανθρωπότητας, σε μια εποχή όπου όλα φαίνονται να είναι σχετικά, ακόμα και η ίδια η επιστήμη.

Η μετάφραση του Θωμά Μαστακούρη μεταφέρει, από τα δυσνόητα και οριακά υπερβατικά κινέζικα τόσο τις έννοιες όσο και, πολύ πιο σημαντικό, το κλίμα που ήθελε να μεταδώσει ο συγγραφέας, και για την κοινωνική αλλά και για την πολιτική κατάσταση που επικρατούσε, κατά την γνώμη του, την περίοδο της Πολιτιστικής Επανάστασης, ένα διάστημα για το οποίο η αλήθεια είναι πως οι ιστορικές αναφορές είναι αμφιλεγόμενες.

Το Πρόβλημα των Τριών Σωμάτων έχει γράψει ήδη τη δική του ιστορία στον χώρο της επιστημονικής φαντασίας, όντας, με τις αδυναμίες και τις προκαταλήψεις του, η φαντασία που έχουμε ανάγκη: μια γερή υπενθύμιση της αξίας του εδώ και του τώρα, μια απόπειρα για ένα παράθυρο στο Πραγματικό.

"Well, I finally did read The Three-Body Problem, just in time for the Netflix series to come out! Which I haven't seen yet, by the way. (There is also a 30-episode Chinese original available, with subtitles.) Given this first entry, I am looking forward to the second volume in what is now a quadrilogy, The Dark Forest. Back to The Three-Body Problem, Cixin does an excellent job at keeping the narrative going while at the same time balancing flashbacks and present events, not to mention alternating action sequences and explanations of the necessary theoretical background. Speaking of the latter: I'm no physicist, so I'm not sure what to make of the notion of protons being folded in different dimensions and used to do what they do in the novel. Seems extraordinary to me, but I don't have the technical knowledge necessary to assess just how extraordinary. As a biologist, I wasn't too taken by the idea of the Trisolarians ""dehydrating"" in order to survive their chaotic eras. I can see why natural selection would favor such a strategy, and we do have examples of so-called xerotolerance on Earth, though they usually concern bacteria or small eukaryotes. The best known example is that of Tardigrades, and I wonder whether Cixin was not inspired by what we know of those creatures. Would something like that work for complex organisms like the Trisolarians? I doubt it. Still, it's a clever plot device, and there is only so much scientific realism one should except from a science fiction novel.

"The Three body problem is a read that makes you think, analyze and reciprocate to the thoughts it poses. Its a sci-fi story with a lot of heart, regrets and built on moments of revolution. A revolution that has such a great influence and impact on its survivors that humanity for them, has lost its way on the path of evolution. In early part of the book, science is tied to political propaganda, cultural impact and humanity.

As the title suggests, the novel explores and relies heavily on the very real three body problem that has been worked upon by many physicists and mathematicians over the years. I am sure there exists novels which has used this problem as a plot point but the way Liu treats the problem is probably unique.

The most striking aspect of the novel is the underlying philosophy that Liu carries out throughout the novel. For every character who has immense scientific knowledge, they come with an extreme reading on moral compass in their view on humanity at large. Firstly there is Ye, who sees the horror of cultural revolution (late '60s) when her father is publicly executed as her mother speaks against his perspective on science and technology. The impact this incident has on her can potentially change the course of humanity. Wang Miao is a modern day scientist working on nanotechnology who gets involved with a bunch of scientists at the insistence of military, police etc. By chance he happens on a game called The Three body problem that sets of the second act of the story.

The pacing till the beginning of second act of the story is good with an intricate plot and bit of science. In the second act however, its mostly about the game, science and some more science. As an engineer, I loved it all. The game takes place in a world that has three suns and has a chaotic environment. The players have to work around the harsh climatic conditions and ensure that the race evolves, advances and lives. Every time Wang goes into the game, he enters a specific period in civilization where he has to work with tools and technology available at that time to ensure the people survive the chaotic era or a climatic change that can potentially destroy the civilization. Every civilization reaches a specific point in history and then perishes.I enjoyed reading the ways the great contemporary minds of the civilization would come together and tries to solve the problem. The most interesting one was Newton and Neumann using humans (Chinese soldiers) to solve a complex mathematical equation. Once Wang starts moving up the level he figures out where this is all going.

All the science aside, the story has a lot of heart. Liu exposes the horrific byproduct of progress and advancement in technology. The characters reflect this ideology where there are bunch of scientists who are simply weary in the way humanity is progressing while there are some who still have hope and do things because they have to be done. My favorite character is Da Shi, a policeman who is street smart and does things because they have do be done. Its a simplistic view without any grandiose but is the most hopeful character in the novel. Ye, loses hope when violence seeps into ideology instead of a discussion and betrayal becomes a recurring theme in her life. Wang, interestingly loses and gains hope during his interaction with different factions people belong or when he is playing the game.

I am not sure if all the information given in this book was entirely necessary to reach the end. If few pages of information was skipped, it will still be okay. I am guessing all these information - which are given in report format will be important for the sequels. Liu uses fascinating metaphors to summarize the situation or the context where science or mathematics describe a philosophical observation or an extremely vulnerable situation. They were accurate and delivered the emotional punch the context was aiming for.

Eagerly looking forward to read the next one.

"Science Fiction is one of my favourite genres, mostly because it has the ability to make us think about important philosophical ideas contextualised in a way that makes them hard to ignore, like we do in our everyday life. It has also the ability to imagine the future, create technologies that amaze us, or terrify us, show us what might happen, project unto the future our wildest dreams and desires, or our darkest fears.
It's also a genre that has been so exploited, that original ideas are dwindling, or better put yet, our technology and understanding of the world changes and evolves so quickly, that it's really hard for a work of fiction to stand the pass of time and not lose value.

The Three Body Problem has a lot of originality, although the general idea of the first contact is not a new one, it's been worked and re worked countless times, but in general, it's always in a more action, epic oriented power fantasy, or a more individualistic, intimate approach. Meaning its either used as an excuse for all out war, and how that might affect us as a species (think Haldeman and Forever War), or in a more intimate way, to see how the first contact changes individuals, or how the impact the first contact had on society affects a specific individual (Enders Game).
Cixin Liu's approach seems different. It's more subtle, and it's more Science oriented.
While reading the authors postscript I confirmed what I already suspected, this author is REALLY interested in Science, he goes out of his way to make everything make sense, to make everything about science. Our understanding of the laws that define the inner workings of the world are what drives the plot, what drives the narrative.
Liu takes his time to make the reader understand the science behind what's going on, and he goes ou of his way to make the 3 body problem theme permeate the book, so the reader can identify it easily, understand its implications and like that, understand the book better.

Being such a hard SciFi book has its downsides, and it is mostly that, when this exposition dumps take place, the pace of the books spirals down into a sluggish nightmare.... Well, I'm being a little bit dramatic. Liu uses the dialogues that have this expositions in a very clever way, he either mixes them with character development to make them more palatable, or he does so with the presentation of the 3body game, which makes the sluggish pace less awkward, at least a little bit.

If this book had been written by a non Chinese author, the chapters regarding the cultural revolution would have been cringy to read, as a work of literature created by someone who actually lived through those times, they take a different texture, it feels like a critique in a way, and in others a praise... It does have its nuance, and that makes it even more interesting, although there is some absence of respect towards political ideology, this book respects one thing highly, and that is SCIENCE.

I loved the story. Found the characters plain and one dimensional, but well written enough to make me keep my interest on them. What shines here is the science, the explanations, the ideas, and the overall story that takes place. The beauty of the parallelism between our race, and the aliens. It wasn't even subtle, as the chapter that describes the first contact, from Ye's perspective and from the Alien in the post 1379 are a mirror, but one that distorts the image enough to make it more interesting.

I understand the hype around the book. And I really want to read the next one.




PD: The one thing that bothered me a lot throughout the book, is this unnecessary requirement of a character to have a wife and kids who are never talked about in a meaningful way. I realise this is not a particular issue of this book, but one of male dominated media in general, but being a father has made me more receptive towards family dynamics in media and this artificial way of being an absent family man pisses me off now.

"Definitely between a 2 and 3, but on the lower spectrum in my opinion.

The first half of this book was pretty good. It hooked me in with the Cultural Revolution, the plot around the Ye family, and the mysteries surrounding Wang.

...And then suddenly aliens were introduced, which seemed like an extremely random plot that was tying everything together with thin, flimsy strings. It felt like there were three independent stories (Ye's story, Wang's story, and the Three Body game) and then halfway through the book, the author decided he wanted to write about aliens taking over the world. It just didn't seem to fit, and as a result everything in the second half of the book was forcefully construed to work around the random alien plot.

"I'd join the pro-alien cult, I fear.

I don't know how it's possible to write sci-fi this insane that feels grounded in real math/physics theories. Perhaps Liu Cixin had extraterrestrial help... If you need really good characters/relationships to like a book, you won't like this. They're all indifferent towards each other and introduce themselves in strange monologues that feel reminiscent of role playing games. This however, didn't bother me because I was dazzled by the sci-fi.

"I’ve been intending to read this book for a while, and when I saw it was the April 2017 read of the Hard SF Group on Goodreads, I got a copy from my local library. This is the first of a trilogy known as “Remembrance of Earth’s Past”.

Liu Cixin in a well-known award-winning science fiction writer within China, and this work was first serialized in 2006 and then published as a book in 2008. It won the Chinese Science Fiction Galaxy Award in 2006. Later, it was translated to English by sf writer Ken Liu, and that was published in 2014. It won the Hugo Award in 2015, and was also nominated for 2014 Nebula.

The opening chapters are set in China’s 1960s Cultural Revolution. Even though science fictional aspects are barely hinted at, I was immediately intrigued by the personal situation of Ye Wenjie. I was a child in the US at that time, and the inner workings of China were very mysterious. Since then, I have worked with one or two colleagues who actually lived through that time in China. More recently, Chinese colleagues seem to have very little to say about it, perhaps they are too young - or perhaps they feel it best left unspoken of.

The second section develops the situation mysteriously, and I was at times reminded of the weirdness of Jeff Vandermeer’s Southern Reach trilogy. A succession of explanations of the fictional (I assume) Red Coast base reveal layers of interpretation of the events, each feasible, but making more sense than the previous. This strong flow of story is disturbed in the third and final section by the introduction of a misanthropic global social/political movement. Perhaps, to a readership that has the Cultural Revolution in its background, this could feel more possible, but to me it seemed unjustified.

So I drop my rating down from 5* to 4 ½. I am definitely planning to read the rest of the trilogy. There are speculative concepts worth discussing, but they amount to spoilers if you haven’t read the book.

"One of the most original science fiction books of 2014-2015. Translated by the first time for English reading audiences by Ken Lui, it is an amazingly complex, diverse, expansive, but yet completely approachable book.

First off, let me say that the translator did a fantastic job with the book. This was actually my initial hesitation in picking up the book to begin with was I was worried about how the writing style and the translation would compute with Western thinking. Boy was I wrong about that! Not only did I learn alot about the history of China, the translator seemed to know exactly what to write to get across the beautiful writing of Liu Cixin.

The story itself is a masterful one, and I am so pumped that there are two more books after this one. Well, I mean, if you get to the ending, you know that there HAS to be more books!

There was a time close to the beginning of the book where I thought reading it would be a chore, but the book sped up immensely and the revelations that are shown are truly unique. Some of the more original thinking I have seen in recent years in the near future realm of science fiction.

This is a bit political thriller, science fiction, hard scifi, a bit general thriller, and a bit techo-thriller, all in one. I am not really sure who to compare this author to. A bit of Neal Stephenson maybe, without so many words, and then a bit of Alastair Reynolds and his views on hard science fiction and universe building as well.

Before I was halfway done with the first book, I ordered the second, ""The Dark Forest"" and it is currently sitting right beside me, ready to go as soon as I finish this review. So I am amped up right now to see where this next story goes as The Three-Body Problem leaves the reader on quite a cliffhanger.

As far as the three body problem itself is concerned, if anyone doesn't know the issues surrounding that, and then the philosophical debates that Cixin uses in the title to give it double meaning throughout the story, I would suggest readers to just quick Wikipedia Three Body Problem, just to know ahead of time what it's about. It is explained in the book, but it may help those that aren't full dorks like myself!

Not ashamed to give this one a 5 star rating and I am anxious to get on to the 2nd out of the three books that are in this trilogy!

"Ok ok ok: I hear you. The Three Body Problem is far from an easy read. Something feels off, alien, at times. We can talk till the cows come home about how character motivations seem thin despite the tools for their success being right there. We can talk about how often the novel evolves into a sort of philosophical debate, and the plot revolves around the ability to work in service of such debates. We can also pick at Ken Liu, the translator’s, diction, and talk about the perceived distance between ourselves and the text.

All of this isn’t particularly engaging a line of critique, even if it is true. In reading this novel, I think it is crucial to ask ourselves where we are coming from. If you are primarily a reader of Western work, of English language work, or of non Science Fiction work, then of course there is a strong level of distance between you and the Chinese Science Fiction novel you are now contending with. The distance is natural, and as the reader who willingly picked it up, the onus is on us to earnestly give this book a chance in all its weird glory. And I think it is a weird book, but I think it’s important to check my literary biases at the door and be open to what Liu was trying to say and that art he is trying to make. I think he attempts something very specific, and is trying to work at a very certain thing, even if it doesn’t naturally fit in my expectations as a Western educated reader.

And I think this is okay. I think it’s good, even. It’s an exercise of being open minded and thinking through the very real ethical and scientific issues that he’s trying to bring to the fore. Sometimes, the science is a little tough for me to understand. But that’s okay. I just have to work harder to understand it.

So, if you’re thinking of picking this up, remind yourself that this will be a challenge, and open your mind to the story at hand. Because it’s grand, eloquent, and very very beautiful. It is flawed, but only if you really consider how we have been taught since childhood to perceive and understand story, character, and motivation from a specific line of thinking.

"I just finished The Three-Body Problem. It started off very well -- all the stage-setting and initial confusion really drew me in -- but, unfortunately, after about the first third it got bogged down in poor pacing and excessive exposition, and decided to be more-or-less a loooooooooong exploration of thought puzzles instead of a novel. And even worse than that, there were glaring logic holes in most of the ideas being brought forward.


It *was* interesting to see a story written from a completely different cultural perspective, and that included the Chinese politics,
, and the tone of the ending (
). And I think the novel is likely to gain a lot of Hugo traction for those reasons -- but I won't be voting for it to win.

I kept feeling echoes of both Anathem and Baudolino throughout, in that they all poke at the natures of reality and religion. But I think both Anathem and Baudolino came much closer to accomplishing their goals than this did.

As for the narration, Luke Daniels is competent enough, but not extraordinary in any way. He's better in a modern UF setting, like the Iron Druid books -- he really doesn't have much in the way of voicing or accents -- but he isn't an actively bad reader either.

I got so irritated by the overwhelming exposition and logic holes by the end that I'm only going to give this about 2.5 stars over all -- rounding down to 2.

"Певно, якби я дізнався про цю трилогію лише зараз, то я б її не читав. Суто через те, що не дуже на часі читати книгу китайського фантаста, враховуючи складну комунікацію між Китаєм та Україною (хоча ніби ""перші контакти"" відбулись, і ніби як успішні). Але оскільки ""Пам'ять про минуле Зе��лі"" я хотів прочитати вже десь років 5, то вирішив для початку погуглити, чи зашкварювався Лю Цисінь, висловлюючи щось нехороше про Україну. Погуглив - нічого не знайшов. Лише скандал з Netflix через коментарі Лю про уйгурів 🤔

Тож вирішив, що можу з обережністю піти на свій ""перший контакт"" з трилогією, щоб прочитати про ""перший контакт"" землян з інопланетянами 😎

Що я скажу - напружив лише початок, де згадувалась Культурна революція в Китаї. Але вона подана як історична подія, без рефлексій автора, і до того - там якраз показана революційна жесть, а не її схвалення. Раз вже заговорив про мінуси, то відразу згадаю всі: не глибокі персонажі, вузька локація (дуже епічно все, але відбувається все в Китаї), забагато (як на мене) фізики. Та і все.

""Проблема трьох тіл"" - це крута наукова фантастика. Прочитав за декілька днів, і це був хороший спосіб хоч трішки зняти напругу, бо дні були морально важкі. Стиль приємний, перклад вогонь, тема цікава, є місце для саспенсу, особливо коли очікуєш, що ось-ось має відбутись ""перший контакт"". Мене лякали імена, бо всі ці Шао Лінь, Є Веньцзе, Ян Дун, Ван Мяо непросто запам'ятати, але чим далі читаєш, тим все зрозуміліше.

Як я вже писав, події відбуваються в Китаї. Охоплюють десь 50-60 років з моменту Культурної революції (1966). Основні дійові особи - науковці, силовики. Події подані в ретроспективі, адже ми на початку можемо знати, коли, наприклад, загине одна з головних героїнь (щось подібне робить Кінг). Основна інтрига - на Землі відбувається щось дивне, армії світу в бойовій готовності, але ми, як читачі, достеменно не розуміємо, що саме коїться. Лише знаємо, що якось це пов'язане з позаземним життям. Власне, цей інтерес і розкручується, тому перестати читати важко.

Пропаганди не помітив. Читав відгуки інших - вони також. Може 1-2 моменти, які не впливають взагалі, і їх не помітити, якщо спеціально не шукати. Починаю читати ""Темний ліс"", другу частину трилогії.

Слухала в аудіо і кайфувала від голосу, від подачі. Хоча і було важкувато з усіма цими китайськими іменами і фізично-математичними теоріями. Найбільше з фізично-математичними теоріями, тому що їх було багато. Імя-то хоча б запамятати можна, а теорію краще б розуміти для того, аби насолоджуватися сюжетом. Ця наукова фантастика дійсно наукова.
Перша книга - це історія не тільки Трисолярису, першого контакту, а також історія Є Веньдзє. Маленької людини, розумної-розумної, вченої, котру перемололо китайською культурною революцією. Вона не змогла прийняти новий світ, збагнути жорстокість, побачити щось поза дикістю хуйвейбінів та першими десятиліттями революції. Вона залишилась там, в спортивному залі, де вбили її батька - і так ніколи насправді не змогла вийти з нього. Весь жах її тодішньої спровокував наступні події. Хто зна як людство - о, ні, правління Китаю - віднеслось до першого контакту, але маємо що маємо. З цим тепер людству в трилогії жити. Трішки знаючи улюблені китайські сюжетні мотиви, сподіватися на хеппі енд в західному, - а тим більш американському його сенсі - не приходиться.
Подивимось, що буде далі.
Читається книга легко, тому що і переклад, і редактура на висоті. Круто зроблено. Стиль написання легкий.

"11th book for 2016.

Given all the hype given to this book I quite disappointed after reading it.

The plot of the book itself is quite simple and really just a set-up for the remaining two books in the trilogy (my final judgment on this book will depend a lot on how the other books go - the third book will be published in English in late 2015).

The parts of the book set in modern (or near future) China, perhaps for practical political reasons, are very poorly developed, and could have just as easily been set in the USA or Europe or where ever. The more interesting parts are either set during the cultural revolution or in the three-body game.

I don't know if this is a result of poor translation or the poor quality of the original text, but the motivations of the characters are often hard (if not impossible) to understand.

This is a hard(ish) scifi book, and keeping with this there are lots of ideas (the author has a nasty tendency to 'info-dump'), however some of the ideas (e.g., computational protons) seemed more fantasy than scifi. I found the game (which takes up a large part of the book) initially interesting, but also unbelievable. There was no sense of how this was actually a game or how it served the purpose it was supposed to (winning over humans to the Trisolarian cause). Given its final inevitable outcome it seemed largely pointless.

I had hoped that the three-body problem would turn out to have a second clever metaphorical meaning relating to the interaction between human/alien societies, or at least hint at some really cool mathematical solution, but alas this was not to be.

I give this three stars because some of the situations and ideas were interesting, and there was enough plot to keep me engaged till the end of the book. I will probably read the other two books in the series, but I won't be rushing to do so.

"Since this one pipped The Goblin Emperor to the post for a Hugo, I was very curious to read it. Buuut, a bunch of people who normally share my taste in books found it boring and completely flat, so I was a little apprehensive. Part of the problem is, I think, the cultural translation: Ken Liu added some explanations and footnotes, but the tone still isn’t very Western. The writing feels really flat and simple: this character did this. He took something out of his pocket and did something with it. Then he smiled. It doesn’t flow in the same way as most Western writing, to my mind. The translation works in that it keeps a sense of the original, but I’m not sure that was the best decision in terms of an engaging tone in English translation.

I was intrigued by the story, anyway, and honestly loved the way it was thoroughly rooted in Chinese culture and the Cultural Revolution. I didn’t know that much about it, but I enjoyed learning (and doing some extra reading). The Trisolaris sections are rather odd — suddenly Copernicus? Einstein? What? I didn’t understand what exactly was going on with the characters, though the idea of Trisolaris is compelling. The hard SF concepts were… less easy for me to grasp. You’re unfolding a proton into two dimensions? What, why? I’m confused…

But the central conflict, the idea of there being people who have so far given up on humanity that they called to aliens to invade… yes, that is intriguing, and it’s that plot which makes me want to read the next book. It’s more of an ideas book than one about characters, which is usually less appealing to me, but I’m intrigued enough by the plot that I think I will read on.

(Do I think it should have beaten The Goblin Emperor? Not in a million years.)

"Ne. Ovo nije problem triju tijela, ovo je problem dosadne proze. Problem izgubljenih sati mog života u posljednjih mjesec i pol dana. Problem odlične ideje i užasavajuće dosadne egzekucije. Krenimo od likova. Ok, likovi u hard SF knjigama služe ideji pa razumijem da su likovi flat. Osobnost im je na razini biljke. Ispričavam se biljkama i obožavam gledati time lapse rasta istih… ali one se barem razvijaju za razliku od Cixinovih. Što se tiče radnje, dijelovi kineske nedavne povijesti su uvršteni da zadovolje cenzore i eto da pokažu kako su ljudi zločesti pa se naša Ye Wenjie odlučila na poteze o kojima neću previše da ne pokvarim dosadu čitatelja. Dijelovi sa virtualnom stvarnošću i problemom triju tijela su najbolji, stvarno dobra ideja s povijesnim likovima i s onim i ustvari me to držalo da dovršim knjigu. Usput mi je mozak dehidrirao i stvarno se moram natjerati da odustajem od knjiga koje su mi dosadne.
P.S
Ovo je 2015. dobilo nagradu Hugo za najbolji roman (iako je napisana puno ranije ali eto prijevod u Americi je izašao 2014. pa je upala). Ta godina je bila (kao i nekoliko prije i poslije) kontroverzna zbog pokreta Sad Puppies. Za one koji ne znaju, to je desničarski dio pisaca i urednika spekulativne fikcije koji je imao ideju da nominiraju djela većinom bijelih muškaraca pod izlikom da je politička korektnost previše zašla u SF. S pravom je došlo do bojkota pa su sve njihove nominacije izgubile jer su birana djela izvan njihovog kruga nominacija (kao Liu Cixin) ili je glasan tzv. No Award pa nitko nije dobio Huga. Ironično je to što je pobijedio Cixin koji je otvoreno podržao koncentracijske logore za ujgurske muslimane i uživa u naklonosti svoje države sumnjivih zakona što se tiče slobode govora. O cenzuri da ne govorim. Svijet je lopta šarena.

"This book really made me sit down and do my thinks! It's a scientific page-turner about an impending invasion of Earth steeped in Chinese history. It starts on a high-note, while still taking its sweet time in developing the plot, which I kind of appreciated. This is the first book in a trilogy so I went in expecting to get a delayed pay-off, so I was cool with getting to know these characters before the plot kicked into high gear.

This is a political work as much as a sci-fi one. In the author afterwards, Liu talks about how he specifically doesn't write sci-fi as thinly-veiled critique of the real world. Still, it's hard not to see a lot of parallels between the sci-fi world and the real one while reading a book like this. I don't want to go into specifics for fear of triggering spoilers, but I will say that a central tenet of the novel is a question of responsibility: Who is responsible for what and to what extent can an individual effect change on a local or global scale.

I'm glad this book came across my radar. I love reading books in translation and this one is a great example of why it's such a treat to do so. The language and the structure of the novel are markedly different from what you find in contemporary American fiction. As a writer, I find it refreshing and inspiring to encounter texts that differ from what I'm accustomed to reading. In particular, Liu does some interesting work with exposition. I'm looking forward to starting the second in the series after a brief pause to clear my palate.

Highly recommended.

"""Should philosophy guide experiments, or should experiments guide philosophy?""

All it takes for humans to reflect on of how insignificant they and their little earthly affairs are, is just one look at the vast expanse of night sky. We are like tiny ants fighting another set of tiny ants for a chunk of food in a sweet box which we think will remain stable forever.

What if a technologically advanced alien force launches a probe to visit us and shatter our illusion of stability? Who will be the real enemy then? Will we try to use it to serve our own goals to annihilate the incorrigible human race, unaware that the beings of this extra stellar civilization in a chaotic system are intimidated with our progress and they will always use this enmity to reset our evolutionary clock.

This philosophical conundrum serves as a premise to explore the possibility that we aren't alone in this universe.

How are we to fight an alien superpower which uses the supercomputer size of a proton to spy on every terrestrial activity?

The first part of this series transformed the mainstream world of thriller to spike your imagination with its speculative fiction bordering apocalyptic space opera with its 3 intervening plots to speak beyond the cultural background it is set in but it's just a prelude to a much larger mystery.

I was put off by its mediocre writing but since the second part seems slightly promising, so I think the literary essence was lost in translation but it rightly deserves the accolades it won for delving a little deeper into particle physics, game theory, orbital mechanics, pan-species communism, super string theory, all combined to make a strange world of 3 suns accessible to an ordinary hard science fiction enthusiast.

"Αυτό το βραβευμένο βιβλίο επιστημονικής φαντασίας ασχολείται με το κλασικό ζήτημα της επαφής του ανθρώπου με έναν εξωγήινο πολιτισμό. Η προσέγγιση του κινέζου συγγραφέα, πολύ διαφορετική από τη συνηθισμένη δυτική είναι αναζωογονητική αλλά και συχνά ξενίζει, κάτι που μπορεί να οφείλεται και στις δυσκολίες της μετάφρασης η οποία δεν κατάλαβα εάν έγινε από τα αγγλικά ή από το κινεζικό πρωτότυπο. Στην καρδιά κάθε βιβλίου επιστημονικής φαντασίας βρίσκεται φυσικά η επιστήμη και οι δυνατότητές της και αυτό δεν αποτελεί εξαίρεση, συχνά μάλιστα σε σχεδόν δυσνόητο βαθμό. Το βασικό ζήτημα είναι το πρόβλημα των τριών σωμάτων του τίτλου, η αδυναμία δηλαδή, εάν κατάλαβα καλά, των φυσικών να προβλέψουν τον τρόπο που τρία σώματα που έλκονται βαρυτικά μεταξύ τους θα κινηθούν το ένα σε σχέση με το άλλο. Κύριο πρόσωπο του βιβλίου είναι η Γέι, μια κινέζα αστροφυσικός απογοητευμένη και πολιτικά στιγματισμένη μετά την άγρια δολοφονία του πατέρα της, επίσης φυσικού, στη διάρκεια της πολιτιστικής επανάστασης που εργάζεται πλέον σε μια απομακρυσμένη επιστημονική εγκατάσταση με σκοπό την επικοινωνία με τυχόν νοήμονα όντα στο διάστημα. Μέσα από τη θέση αυτή έρχεται πρώτη σε επικοινωνία με έναν εξωγήινο πολιτισμό που αναζητά κατοικήσιμους πλανήτες καθώς ταλανίζεται από τις συνέπειες των απρόβλεπτων κινήσεων των τριών ήλιων του με αποτέλεσμα αλλεπάλληλες καταστροφικές χαοτικές περιόδους. Οι συνέπειες αυτής της αρχικής επαφής τη δεκαετία του 70 όπως τις ανακαλύπτει σταδιακά ένας φυσικός στη σύγχρονη Κίνα αποτελούν το θέμα του βιβλίου. Αν και ενδιαφέρον ως ιδέα το βιβλίο πάσχει σημαντικά στο επίπεδο των χαρακτήρων που παραμένουν εντελώς αναληθοφανείς, επίπεδοι και αδιάφοροι.

"Sin duda es uno de los libros de ciencia ficción que he leído que más me ha impactado y más me ha hecho reflexionar, pensar y disfrutar con la bien dosificada especulación científica que Cixin Liu ha plasmado en sus páginas.
Aunque el estilo es un poco sobrio y directo, -yo diría que es un thrileer científico-, consigue que en más de una y de dos ocasiones sientas ese sentido de la maravilla que a los aficionados de la ciencia ficción tanto nos gusta.
Si bien hay una importante crítica social a la humanidad, a su evolución y sus prejuicios, ésta parte de un punto de vista oriental (la cada vez más importante potencia China) que lo hace más original. La novela también permite gozar de la maravilla que supone imaginar una civilización extraterrestre y las repercusiones para ambas civilizaciones tras su contacto.
Un poco de historia científica, dosis de realidad virtual, especulación científica e intriga (tipo thriller) en el mundo científico (de peso específico sin ser demasiado hard), mensajes por microondas viajando por el espacio, nanomateriales, nuevas dimensiones físicas y el universo de posibilidades que abre el primer contacto con una civilización extraterrestre.
No quiero hacer spoilers ni pretendo hacer una reseña (mejor leer la del Biblionauta que es muy buena: )
Recomiendo indudablemente leer esta novela. Espero que pronto tengamos la segunda parte de la trilogía en castellano (y la tercera).

"No tengo palabras para decir lo completamente asombroso que me pareció este libro. Es brillante. Es ciencia ficción dura, es decir, con mucha ciencia (aunque suene tonto) y muchas explicaciones que se basan en teorías. Entonces, por momentos cuesta entender o seguir el ritmo, pero en general se puede.

Básicamente, trata sobre una serie de suicidios entre famosos científicos y una organización internacional que intenta buscar la explicación detrás de estos. Sumado a una serie de eventos extraños que amenazan la vida de Wang Miao, el científico encargado de la producción de nanomateria que es el hilo conductor de la historia.
Todo partió casi cuarenta años atrás cuando en China se vivieron unos momentos complicados, en particular, para ciertos científicos a los que se les acusó de crímenes contra la Revolución. La muerte de Ye Zhetai desencadenó en su hija una serie de sentimientos confusos que la llevaron a tomar decisiones drásticas a lo largo de su vida.

Sé que suena vago, pero no puedo ser más clara sin dar spoilers. Lo importante es que lo vayan descubriendo a medida que lo lean. Me gustó la forma en que abordan los peligros de los avances desmedidos de la ciencia, la preocupación medioambiental y la forma en que la humanidad parece estar cayendo por un precipicio. En un comienzo es confuso saber hacia dónde va o para qué sirve lo que están contando, pero luego todo toma sentido y es fantástico.
Es una historia asombrosa que muero de ganas de continuar.

De rijzende ster aan het immer uitdijende Science-Fiction firmament is de Chinees Liu Cixin wiens revolutionaire Remembrance of the earth’s past-trilogie al miljoenen fans vergaarde waaronder Barack Obama, George R.R. Martin en Netflix-regisseur David Benioff.

In dit eerste deel tracht de nanotechnoloog Wang Miao een reeks mysterieuze zelfmoorden onder wetenschappers te ontrafelen. Op zijn zoektocht ontdekt hij hoe uiteenlopende zaken gelinkt zijn: een politieke moord tijdens het Mao-tijdperk, een geheimzinnig project dat signalen het heelal instuurt en een Virtual Reality-spel. Cixin geeft zichzelf de perfecte voorzet om zijn verbeelding onbegrensd te laten stromen met dit computerspel waarin wereldvermaarde filosofen en wetenschappers figureren die trachten de onvoorspelbare interactie tussen drie zonnen (het drielichamenprobleem) te ontcijferen in een duizelingwekkend decor van merkwaardige beschavingen en natuurverschijnselen.

Cixin rijgt maatschappelijke, ecologische en religieuze elementen aan een plotlijn die slingert tussen fonkelnieuwe natuurkundige inzichten. Hij slaagt er zelfs in om bij de aartsmoeilijke uitweidingen rond astrofysica de frustratie van het ongrijpbare voor de personages én voor de lezer telkens te doen uitmonden in de aha-ervaring van de vondst. Deze onvergelijkbare literaire maalstroom stompt zo hard tegen de buitengrenzen van natuurkunde, gaming én fictie, dat we gerust de term ‘briljant’ vanonder het sterrenstof mogen blazen.

"A very interesting and highly imaginative story reminiscent of The Terminator and Independence Day in some ways. The book does have its share of slightly dull moments and literary chaos (especially when it talks about the history of the Adventists and the Redemptionists), but in a lot of parts it picks up pace amazingly well and describes some really creative happenings and ideas.

While reading there were places where I just could not put the book down thanks to vivid descriptions and interesting events sprinkled all around the pages; parts of the story have been written brilliantly (in other places the translation to English probably didn't work out well - as the puts it succinctly, ).

Overall, the author seems to be really imaginative and passionate about the story but fares poorly on general character development, and falls prey to describing scientific minutiae not adding anything interesting to the story's flow; the intertwining of science and fiction could have been much smoother.

Nevertheless, it's quite gripping for the most part and worth a read. Can't wait to get on to the next couple of books in the series.

"In short - Brilliant

Set in China from the cultural revolution and up to today we get an insight into an era and location which was rather unknown to me, which only makes the book more interesting.

The book can seem a little in accessible at start due to the Chinese names but luckily the author limits himself to a few characters in focus so we can remember them.

It's a strange mixture of hard sci-if (with long technical discussions and info dumps) and cyber punk a little like Neal Stephenson's early books.

It also describes how a inhuman system which crushes the individual can lead to counter reactions, like turning your back on the whole human race, maybe something to consider looking at today's terror organisations and why some people join them.

So why not five stars..

At times the explanations to overhand and killed the narrative and there are a strange detached style to story which makes it a little hard to actually care for the characters.

"Very unique first contact story. The author mixes a blend of Chinese history to give context and characterization to the story and to explain the motivations behind the characters. The initial mystery presented at the beginning is fully delivered at the end. Great use of current theoretical physics concepts: quantum entanglement, string theory, multi-dimensional analysis and the three body problem. The author very cleverly entwined fantastical physics concepts into his science fiction. In addition, the story touches on several cultural issues: intellectual elitism, genocide, communism, ecological conservation and nationalism.

My critique is the writing style in that there is no writing style. The narration lacks character and is mostly a deadpan, boiler plate voice. Having said that, the translation seems to be great, I just think the original author lacks a stylistic voice. At some points, he gets pretty narration heavy to move the plot along. It's not elegant but it works.

I will definitely be reading the rest of the series.

"A brilliant book of hard sci-fi which is based in China but has an international appeal. It is very well written/translated and takes me back to the feeling I had reading Asimov and Clarke. It is huge in scale and revolutionary in the ideas it presents despite being based on a strong foundation (heh) of classic sci-fi, physics, and human behavior. The characters feel real with their idiosyncrasies and actions. The setting and the references to the Chinese culture, history, and literature adds an added dimension to an excellent book; it makes it stand out among other modern sci-fi books and the references actually add a lot to the story and the book instead of being shoe-horned in. The way the characters interact and do the things they do makes sense with respect to the setting of the book.

It is a brilliantly captivating read, fast-paced and unputdownable. Despite it being a big book, the pages just flow as you get addicted to the story-telling. It feels good to read a genuinely mind-blowing book after a few duds and ok ones.

I had to re-read it after 4 years because I'd like to read the rest of the trilogy but I remembered nearly nothing :) After all, I do agree with my previous review.

I'm not so much into SF, but I like trying things :)

It was hard to resist trying 3BP as the book is massively hyped after all these awards across the whole world. Fortunately, it meets the (reasonable) expectations - at least it did in my case. The general idea is interesting, the way plot develops (incl. plot jumps across time) keeps readers engaged, the impact of fictitious events on physics, societies & general environment is credible enough (well, it's still fiction ...).

Characters are specific ... On 1H distinguishable & fit my understanding of Chinese culture specifics, but it's none of them struck me with any unique concept, idea or development.

Tanti sono i collegamenti inaspettati, tanti personaggi ed eventi che vanno e vengono che acquistano e perdono peso come le tessere di un puzzle, tanta è anche la scienza coinvolta quasi a dimostrazione del fatto che un universo con le stesse limitazioni fisiche che ha quello che conosciamo può essere fonte di meraviglia ancora maggiore di uno in cui esiste una specifica tecnologia in grado di aggirare ogni singola equazione mai scritta.

Considering all the hype I really was expecting to rate this book higher, but there were a few issues for me. 1. This book was extremely dense at times, and it took rereading a couple of pages to fully grasp the concepts. 2. Most of the characters were just not believable. Are we just going to ignore the fact that Wang Miao's wife and son only featured to take some photos for him and they never found it strange he spent days on end barely showing his face at home? 3.

"Packed full of math and physics, The Three-Body Problem still felt very accessible by simplifying complex concepts and emphasizing the takeaways needed to understand what is happening without necessarily knowing exactly why.

I really enjoyed how logic gates were explained and I hope some schools do it this way as well - I know mine sure didn’t. The value of exposure to other cultures via media, even if just to a specific aspect of it, was also pretty cool and a very meta concept.

The story got a little dark at one point, but it felt understandable after we got exposed to life during the Chinese Cultural Revolution - something I wasn’t very familiar with.

"I know that most of my science fiction reading is old stuff. I can't remember any science fiction novel I've read published after 1980. So this is a new thing for me, recent science fiction, and from China. I liked much of it. I appreciated the different perspective of culture and history the book provided. It also had me looking up more about the cultural revolution described in the opening chapters. The stuff I didn't get into as much were the virtual reality game chapters. They were interesting enough, and integral to the plot, but didn't resonate with me as much as the human characters did outside those chapters. Other chapters about unfolding photons went way over my simple head. The book poses a lot of philosophical questions for the reader to consider. First contact? Invasion? Which is the right culture to answer for humankind? Are we worth saving, or not?

"I occasionally had to put the book down to just stare at a wall and comprehend things. It puts your mind to the test in the best way possible, while being accessible to most people. It takes you through complex concepts like the birth of the universe, quark theory, nanotechnology, and much more, while not being pretentious and remaining a page turner. I found myself sad I had to put the book down to go to work.
Just don't expect it to be like anything else and you might find a surprise or two. I saw some people comparing it to Dune and this book is not Dune for sure. While both are spectacular, this particular book is not character-driven - it's more about science and world-building.
I recommend going into the book without any prior knowledge. Personally, I'm happy there is an extended weekend ahead of me. Volume 2 all the way!

"To nie jest taki rodzaj książki, które zazwyczaj czytam. Czytało się dobrze, ale nie bez zastrzeżeń - postaci są dość płaskie, a kobiet prawie nie ma. Sposób prowadzenia narracji jest dość nietypowy, więcej jest bohaterom opowiadane niż rzeczywiście się dzieje.

Co było dobre? Sam tytułowy problem trzech ciał i gra. Trochę jak Civilization. Tajemnicze cyfry. Stacja obserwacyjna. To, że nie tylko po realiach widać, że książka powstała w zupełnie innej tradycji kulturowej i literackiej.

"I really enjoyed the imaginativeness of the story. The science bit (except the nanotechnology) was convincing enough to add to the reading experience. The backdrop of Chinese culture (and Cultural Revolution) was refreshing.

On the downsides - some of the storyline felt like a B-level 80s US thriller (tough rule-breaking cop who smokes and drinks, beautiful lady terrorist with handheld nukes) and the protagonist Wang Miao of most of the book did not feel like a real character themselves - more like a vessel through which the story was told.

Just bought the rest of the books in the series, too.

"Genialne połączenie ciężkiego sci-fi, fizyki i gier komputerowych. Dodatkowo dużo się dzięki niej dowiedziałam o rewolucji kulturalnej w Chinach, a ja uwielbiam, gdy w książkach jest jakiś wątek oparty na prawdziwej historii. No i jest tu obca cywilizacja, więc chyba żadna inna książka nie trafi tak idealnie w mój gust czytelniczy.

Nie mówię, że wszystko zrozumiałam (baaardzo dużo różnych fizycznych konceptów tu jest poruszonych). Nie mówię też, że ta książka nie miała wad. Ja jednak wybaczam jej wszystko i wpisuję ją na moją top listę wszechczasów i wątpię, że spadnie z niej w najbliższym czasie.

"Disappointed. I was looking forward to this book. The best thing about it is its window into China - the portrait of the cultural revolution is very poignant and is the emotional center of the book. The science/math aspects are also interesting. But the characters are completely flat or cartoonish. The over arching plot is simple: Aliens! And the particulars of the plot are feeble. I felt very little forward momentum.
That being said, I might read the next two if I can talk the library into buying them.

"This is one of those books that made me really annoyed with life -- why did it keep getting in the way of my reading time?!

I found the novel completely engaging and hard to put down. I'm not saying I understood all the science very well -- physics is not my field -- but what I did understand was fascinating and what went over my head didn't get in the way of my enjoyment. The footnotes were incredibly helpful, as well.

I especially loved Ye Wenjie as a character and enjoyed Wang Miao's journey into understanding. There are some great twists. I need book two ASAP.

"Worse than Asimov. This is not science fiction. Nothing actually based in science in here except a few words like ""proton"" and ""alpha centauri"". Just a load of crystal-healing type pseudoscience. The pathetic part is that the author seriously tries to explain it the way one would explain fundamental physics. They probably think they're being very imaginative and witty by naming characters after great scientists etc but in reality it is difficult to not cringe and take this book as a joke. And it's terribly written/translated, on top of that.

"Maybe 1.5 stars.

It was excruciatingly pedantic with brief moments of brilliance. If you don't read theoretical physics and quantum mechanics for fun then skip it because the fictional story gets lost in the exposition and you'll need a higher than average understanding of both to be able to discern how much of the hard science in this is science and how much is fiction.

Usually I enjoy Luke Daniels' narration, but even that couldn't make this interesting.

Netflix makes it more accessible to general viewer and takes much liberty in script with a mix few of the characters. Book goes deeper in scientific detail and is more esoteric overall.

"Dwie trzecie książki miały ciekawe pomysły, bardzo fajne połączenie gatunków i dobrze napisane sceny. Jednak końcówka to śmiech na sali i nie ukrywam, że ta cała podbudowa jest na wyrost.

Powieść bardzo ciekawie prowadzi wątek kryminalny (samobójstwa wśród czołowych naukowców na świecie), wątek gry wirtualnej w rodzaju AR i historyczną retrospekcję do czasów rewolucji kulturalnej i panującej wtedy paranoicznej, autorytarnej atmosfery politycznej. Ye Wanjie jest bardzo ciekawą, złożoną postacią - jednocześnie cynicznie zahartowana przez doświadczenia totalitaryzmu w Chińskiej Republice Ludowej, zdolna do zbrodni i bezwzględna, ale wciąż niesamowicie idealistyczne i pod wieloma względami naiwna, ale te sprzeczności mogą z sobą współistnieć, a nawet się uzupełniać. W końcu zbrodnie popełnia w imię bardzo idealistycznych założeń.

Niestety, jest jedyną dobrze napisaną postacią w książce. Cała reszta funkcjonuje jako nośniki fabuły i/lub idei naukowo-filozoficznych. Nie wiem, czy to efekt pochodzenia z innej tradycji literackiej, ale dla zachodniego odbiorcy postaci są papierowe i mało wiarygodne. Weźmy Wang Miao - scena, w której odkrywa odliczenia na zrobionych przez siebie zdjęciach jest jedną z najlepszych w książce. Przerażająca, przejmująca i imponująca. Jednakże, kiedy angażuje w odkrycie swoją rodzinę, w tym żonę, przerażoną jego zachowaniem, aby przeprowadzić eksperyment, czy robione przez nich zdjęcia też będą miały odliczanie, wychodzi na wierzch to, że jego bezimienna chyba żona istnieje wyłącznie po to, aby miał kogo poprosić o zrobienie zdjęcia. Nie przejmuje się jej strachem, ani ona ani ich syn nie pojawiają się więcej w myślach postaci, w sumie bohatera drugiej połowy powieści, nawet kiedy podejmuje ryzykowne, niebezpieczne działania - ponieważ emocjonalna strona postaci praktycznie nie istnieje. Plus zaangażowanie żony w robienie zdjęć pokazuje też, do jakiego stopnia męskocentryczna jest narracja i jak alienuje odbiorcę innej płci. Ewidentnie zapłakana, przerażona żona nie ma znaczenia dla fabuły, więc zostawmy te kobiece histerie i skupmy się na cząstkach elementarnych.

Tematy poruszane w powieści też są bardzo ciekawe, głównie zauważalne nastawienie antyintelektualne i antynaukowe oraz mizantropia. Nieco lepsza socjologiczna science fiction wzięłaby na warsztat aktualne przyczyny występowania i popularyzacji tych postaw (kryzys zaufania społecznego, postępująca specjalizacja, elitaryzacja nauki, jej hermetyczny język, informtaiment itd.), zamiast tworzyć teorię spiskową o odgórnym ich kreowaniu, bo to brzmi dość śmieszne. Ludzie mają dość powodów, aby czuć niechęć do naukowców i nauki, dość istotnym jest to, że kapitalistyczny system opiera się na przekonaniu, że wartość nauki opiera się na jej zastosowaniu i możliwych do wyciągnięcia z niej korzyści finansowych, a wszystkie inne gałęzie nauki, w tym nauki miękkie, humanistyczne to bzdura - także dlatego, że ich zdaniem jest autoanaliza panującego systemu i wskazanie jego błędów i ograniczeń, a jak wiemy kapitaliści to snow flaki, które nie radzą sobie z krytyką.

Mizantropia w połączeniu z motywem pierwszego kontaktu jest bardzo ciekawym rozwiązaniem. W tradycji SF zwykle ludzie walczą o przetrwanie swojego gatunku wszystkimi możliwymi środkami i bezrefleksyjnie. Tutaj spora część ludzi ma takie ""tak, ludzkość to ślepa ścieżka ewolucji i powinna zginąć"" - w domyśle, aby ocalić Ziemię. Naiwność tej postawy ujawnia się w tym ostatnim punkcie, bo kto powiedział, że kosmici nie zniszczą też planety i innych gatunków na niej?

Generalnie narracja jest tak samo naiwna i idealistach jak Ye - przesiąknięta przekonaniem, że naukowcy i intelektualiści są wrażliwi i empatyczni, w przeciwieństwie do niewykształconych klas niższych, które są samolubne i nieczu��e na los umierającej planety. Jaki klasizm tu się ujawnia, to aż przerażające. Nie wspominając o tym, że jednym z najbardziej radykalnych zwolenników całkowitej zagłady ludzkości jest amerykański milioner, tj. osoba, która autentycznie mogłaby coś zdziałać na rzecz zmiany systemu, ale a) jest bardzo głupi i krótkowzroczny, czego dowodzi jego działalność w Chinach i b) istnieje w powieści tylko po to, aby ruch miał środki finansowe i to jego jedyna funkcja,nie jest postacią, jest próba łatania fabuły. Nie ma opcji, abym uwierzyła, że milioner mógłby dobrowolnie chcieć zniszczyć system, który przynosi mu korzyści - i powieść nawet nie próbuje zademonstrować, że to mogłoby zadziałać, bo przecież nie robi nic, co mogłoby mieć bezpośrednie konsekwencje w świecie.

Aspekt naukowy początkowo był bardzo ciekawy, pytanie o granice poznania naukowego, o stałość praw fizyki, czy o sam problem trzech ciał - to fascynujące zagadnienia, ale dość szybko powieść wchodzi w bardziej fiction niż science, co normalnie nie byłoby zarzutem, na tym polega urok gatunku, z tym, że tutaj to się robi śmieszne. Czytając o kosmitach, rżałam ze śmiechu, bo jakże rozczarowujące musiało być dla postaci to, że ich cywilizacja niczym nie różni się od ziemskiej. Plus za ironię, minus za rozciągnięcie jej nieproporcjonalnie do potrzeb.

Czy sięgnę po kolejne części? Pewnie tak. Ale porównania do ""Diuny"" i ""Fundacji"" są mocno na wyrost.

"Ох, какво да кажа за тази книга?! Много съм раздвоена в мислите си за нея. От една страна, ако човек няма висше образование по физика, астрофизика, математика и астрономия (аз съм много, много далеч от точните науки), едва ли ще разбере много. Книгата е изпълнена с научни термини, логически умозаключения, епитети и определения от въпросните науки и куп други строги терминологии и обяснения, от които просто бъкел не схванах нищо. Даже се чудех защо ли се мъча като наистина нищо не разбирах (до определен момент). Сега след като вече я завърших и виждам коментарите и се чудя аз ли съм само толкова зле с науката?!
И все пак в един момент схванах идеята на книгата и да интересна и любопитна е, ама пак казвам – защо трябва да е написана на толкова високо научно ниво?
Началото започва през 60-те години, когато управлението на Мао Дзъдун довежда до китайската културна революция и всички произтичащи от това промени и проблеми. Признавам нищо не знаех за този период и затова началото на книгата ми беше изключително интересно. Историята ни пренася в едно смутно комунистическо време, което се опитва да изличи и омаловажи всички научни трудове и открити, а самите хора занимаващи се с наука са заклеймени, оплювани и поругани, някои и убити. Бащата на Йе Уън-дзие от тези именити учени и университетски преподаватели, който е бит до смърт отказващ да признае новите доктрини, а самата Йе Уън-дзие е заточена в станцията Червен бряг, която не е било известно какви точно функции изпълнява.
В наши дни разработчикът на наноматериали Уан Мяо, а по-късно и присъединилия се към него полицай Да Шъ са погълнати от видео игра наречена Трите тела, чието действие се разиграва на непозната планета, на която различни цивилизации се раждат и умират. Някой само ако ми разясни малко повече за играта няма да е лошо – там съвсем ми се изгуби нишката, защото се оказа, че това не е само игра, а действително съществуващ свят в космическото пространство. При това свят, който смята да атакува и завземе Земята!
Така или иначе моментите с играта не ми бяха ясни и много интересни, но всички други причинно-следствени връзки от постъпването на Йе Уън-дзие в радиоастрономическа станция, изпратения сигнал в космоса и получения отговор ми станаха интересни. Представянето на човечеството като едно голямо зло за планетата и останалите форми на живот на нея наистина кара човек да се замисли за начина му на живот и консуматорската му осанка. От друга страна хората са един вид буболечки, които извънземната раса смята да смачка, да унищожи, но ми хареса сравнението със скакалците, които земеделските стопани всякак се опитват да унищожат, а те пак надделяват, така и за хората има шанс да успеят да победят дори научното им развитие да е на светлинни години по назад от извънземните.
Колкото и обаче книгата да беше интригуваща, едва ли бих се справила с нея ако я четях на хартия. Аз я слушах в Сторител и това ми помогна да стигна до края. Ето защо ако озвучат и останалите ще ги изслушам, иначе не бих се мъчила да ги чета, колкото и да съм любопитна как ще се развие действието. Оценката ми е 3* именно заради големия обем информация, който не разбрах, въпреки че знам, че проблемът си е в мен. Ако беше по-достъпно написана щях да дам по-висока оценка. Но нещо на което искам да обърна специално внимание тук е ролята на преводача. Аплодирам този човек – Стефан Русинов и на него давам оценка 10/10* не само заради непосилния вложен труд по превода, а и заради цялата допълнителна информация, която бе поднесена под линия с Бележки от преводача. Огромно браво!

"Ця книга вразила мене поєднанням світів, які мені загалом подобаються, але у моїй голові до цього знаходились на паралельних прямих. Китайська культура та наукова фантастика. Мене вразив сюжет, структура роману, все що стосувалось проблеми трьох тіл і гри у віртуальній реальності. Також було приємно кожен раз бачити різні рідненькі прояви китайської культури, підчитувати словечки ієрогліфами, натрапляти на місця де я бувала, ця суто китайська манера впереміж якихось сухих фактів вставити надто-поетичну фразу про квіточку чи сонечко. Той факт, що фізики мусили старатися у своїх дослідженнях щоб не дай бог не написати «плями на сонці», адже Мао вважався червоним сонечком, а чорні плями легко можна було розтлумачити як символ контрреволюції. Не сподобалось, що настільки ретельно перекладений текст, який нам подарував Євген Ширинос, був трохи недбало вичитаний. Деякі фрази зберігають китайський синтаксис і звучать дивно. Побоювалась, що фізики буде забагато, але це навпаки було цікаво і захоплююче. Наведу кілька класних цитат.
*
Члени «Рубежів науки», обговорюючи фізику, часто використовували абревіатуру «SF». Вони мали на увазі зовсім не «наукову фантастику», а якраз ці два слова «стрілець» і «фермер». Це було відсилання до двох гіпотез, що стосуються природи фундаментальних законів Всесвіту. «Гіпотеза про стрільця» полятає ось у чому: влучний стрілець стріляє по мішені, роблячи отвори через кожні 10 сантиметрів. Припустімо, що площина мішені населена цивілізацією двомірних розумних істот. Їхні вчені після спостереження за власним всесвітом відкрили б великий закон природи: «У всесвіті є отвори кожні 10 сантиметрів». У такому разі, вони б інтерпретували результат сьогочасної примхи стрільця, як непорушний закон всесвіту «Гіпотеза про фермера» також викладається в похмурих тонах фільмів жахів: кожен день об 11-й годині фермер , що розводить індиків, приходить годувати птахів. Вчена індичка, спостерігаючи за такою незмінною моделлю поведінки протягом року, формулює свій великий природи: «Щоранку об 11-й годині з'являється їжа. Вранці у День подяки вона доносить цей закон до інших індичок на фермі. Але до 11-ої години їжа не з'являється, а навпаки - приходить фермер і вирізає все поголів'я птахів на фермі.

Я вважаю що зародження життя на Землі - лише збій у низці випадків у Всесвіті, величезному порожньому палаці, а людство - єдина комашка, яка заблукала випадково в цю величну будівлю. Такі думки перетворили мою другу половину життя на одну нескінченну гризоту про моральні цінності. Іноді мені здається, що людське життя - найвища цінність і все було не дарма; іноді я вважаю людей нікчемними й не вартими навіть згадки про себе, і все було марно.
*
Після того, як я дізнався, що інопланетний флот прямує до Землі, зі мною сталося щось на зразок амнезії . Це так дивно. Я не можу згадати безліч подій. Не пам'ятаю деталей військових операцій, у яких брав участь. Як я вже казав, вони всі тепер здаються настільки незначними. Після пізнання цієї істини всі стають іншими людьми і відкривають для себе світ по-новому . Я тут собі подумав: припустімо, якби людство дві тисячі років тому і навіть раніше, дізналося б, що інопланетні загарбники прибудуть на Землю за кілька тисяч років. Якою була б сьогодні людська цивілізація? Професоре, ви можете собі це уявити?

"Liu Cixin's novel, translated by Ken Liu, starts heartbreaking, becomes slow and seemingly random, and ends awesomely weird and fast paced. Deep thoughts ensue throughout. I see why this won the 2015 Hugo for best novel.

See another version of this review on my blog:

The novel begins in China during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960's-70's. As this is one of the most heartbreaking chapters in the history of the 20th century, it's not surprising that this part of the novel is heartbreaking as a physicist is killed in front of his family by revolutionary youth. I was previously aware of some aspects of the Cultural Revolution, but the translator's footnotes explained a lot of the details (the footnotes aren't obtrusive - in fact, they help a lot). Some reviewers find the writing to be unemotional, but I disagree, especially in how the characters relate to the Cultural Revolution. I can only imagine this resonates even deeper for people who lived in China at the time and for 21st century Chinese citizens coming to grips with this history. The three body problem is an issue in orbital mechanics that plays a role in the book, but metaphorically it could be read as a problem for the relationships - individual, collective, metaphysical - between the past, present, and future. If so, the wobbly temporal structure of the book is no mere accident, but a case of medium as message.

In the second part the novel jumps ahead about 40 years when we meet Wang, a nanomaterials scientist (the book jumps back and forth in time throughout, which can be disorienting, but works for the most part). Wang learns about shadowy organizations that may or may not be connected to scientists who committed suicide and then he starts playing a virtual reality game called Three Body. The scenes in the video game are like psychedelic dreams but readers, along with Wang, come to suspect that something deeper is going on.

Eventually Wang meets Ye Wenjie, astrophysicist and daughter of the murdered physicist from the first part of the book. We get flashbacks about what Ye has been up to for the last 40 years, and eventually we discover that she was involved with first contact with extraterrestrials (we later learn they're called Trisolarians).

While I love the book, my main criticism is that the middle sections lag a bit and don't make much sense until you finish the book (but it does all eventually make sense, so hang in there!). The narrative starts to feel jumbled and confusing a few hundred pages in, especially with all the seemingly random jumping between times and story lines.

I can forgive all this, though, on account of the last 100 pages. They redeem the whole thing. I even came to think that what looked like a jumbled mess in the middle was actually a carefully constructed plot structure designed to come to fruition at the end.

I don't want to say too much about what happens in the last 100 pages, but I will say that fans of hard SF, crazy theoretical physics, conspiracies, deep thoughts about our place in the universe, and/or first contact stories will find this to be worth the price of admission. It's Arthur C. Clarke-style Big Ideas SF.

There's a lot to think about here. Philosophy is mentioned several times, including the Chinese philosopher, Mozi, who is a character in the game. Two major issues are the uniformity of nature and the reaction to extraterrestrial intelligence. In philosophy of science (and regular life for that matter) we all rely on what some philosophers have called the principle of the uniformity of nature. This is usually discussed in (constant) conjunction with David Hume's problem of induction. Could we live as successfully in the world as we do, could we do science, if the laws of nature were not in some sense uniform across time and space? If the laws of nature varied over time or between countries or planets, could we really get around? Could we do science? Or, and this is closer to Hume's point, whether this principle is really true or not, do we have to believe it?

But what if we had lived on a planet where as far as we could tell the laws of nature do sometimes change, where things are never the same over time, could we have evolved as we did and could we have developed science? One of my philosophical quibbles with the novel is that I'm skeptical that, even with the vaster periods of time involved, much of a civilization could develop in such a place at all much less one as advanced as that of the Trisolarians. Such beings may not have even evolved to a point where they could wonder, as Hume did, whether belief in the principle of the uniformity of nature is epistemologically justified. Another philosophical quibble is whether another civilization would necessarily follow the Scientific Revolution-Industrial Revolution-Atomic Age-Information Age progression that was followed on Earth first in the West and then elsewhere. Maybe there are material limitations or structure of the evolution of ideas that govern such progressions, but since we have a limited sample to work from I see see no reason to assume this.

On the issue of extraterrestrial contact, Liu gives a lot to think about. In the novel he presents issues that he explicitly points out in his postscript to the American edition. Should we expect more scientifically advanced civilizations to be more morally advanced than humanity? Would contact with ETs promote a moral evolution in our treatment of other human beings? Is the human race worth saving? Can these questions help us think about coming to grips with our own past (like the Cultural Revolution) and the moral complexities of human nature? Another quibble, which is more with what Liu says in the postscript, is that I totally agree that we should be nice to each other regardless of whether ETs are out there and that we should be cautious, but I think we have so little to work with that it's hard to even play the prediction game about first contact. Sure, part of me hopes ETs are more benevolent than we are, but I admit I have little basis for thinking so aside from the fact that super mean ETs might wipe themselves out, but can we assume that? My main worry would be that our caution would translate, as human caution often tends to here on Earth, into bellicosity: excessive worry about violent conflict could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Perhaps a more open-minded approach in the face of something truly unknown would be wiser. But I'm not sure.

None of my quibbles, either about the writing or the ideas, dampen my enthusiasm for the book. The last 100 pages honestly contained some of the best reading thrills I've had since I finished the Culture novels of . This is exactly why I read both philosophy and science fiction: the deep joy of flights of imagination disciplined by logic. That both Lius (author and translator) gave me a fix of that joy fills me with praise, thanks, and admiration. I'm excited to read the sequels.

"IZRADA KALENDARA ITERATIVNIM PRISTUPOM

Trilogija koje je posljednjih desetak godina često spominjana kao jedna od najboljih SF trilogija u ovom stoljeću konačno je stigla u moje ruke. Radnja je prvotno smještena u zanimljivo vrijeme kulturne revolucije krajem šezdesetih godina prošlog stoljeća u Kini. S obzirom da se radi o dijelu povijesti koji nije često obrađivan u drugim dijelima zapravo vrlo je zanimljivo vidjeti baš tu tema i sve strahote u društvu koje su se događale u to vrijeme kao glavni motivator za djelovanje glavnih likova. Dobro su prikazane strahote koje pojedinac radi za viši cilj i ideale sustava u kojem odrasta, a u konačnici ostane razočaran. Knjiga ne ulazi detaljno u psihologiju mase, ali vjerujem da sve čitatelje potakne da razmišljaju upravo o tom aspektu čovječanstva koji je u povijesti ispisao neka od najtamnijih razdoblja povijesti.

Radnja iz povijesnog okvira dobiva neočekivani smjer u kojem je najintrigantnije kada se pojavi problem triju tijela. Svaki izlet u igru Triju tijela je kao jedna nova zagonetka koja se raspliće pomoću različitih i često nespojivih povijesnih razdoblja i osoba. Mišljenja sam da su baš te epizode najpamtljivije jer se urežu u sjećanje otkrivajući uvijek komadić veće slagalice koja u konačnici ima zadovoljavajući rasplet.

Iako većina ima averziju od fizike kao znanosti, većinom zbog neprilagođenih školskih programa, stil pisanja je pitak tako da čitatelja drži uključenim a opet da ne zvuči prekompleksno u objašnjavanju kretanja planeta, fizičkih zakona i pojava.

Nešto što je također poprilično drugačije je pratiti roman s kineskim imenima. Dojma sam da se pazilo da imena budu jednostavna kako bi i čitatelji izvan okvira Kine mogli lakše pratiti radnju, a popis likova na početku romana dobro dođe za podsjetnik.

Knjiga zapravo u početku nema puno SF elemenata, ali kako radnja odmiče ulazi sve više SF elemenata u priču. Samim raspletom sam zadovoljan, iako generalno cijela prva knjiga služi kao svojevrsna uvertira i postavljanje osnova za nastavke koji su uslijedili. Nastavljam odmah s drugim nastavkom od kojeg puno očekujem. Konačna ocjena je točno između vrlo dobrog i odličnog

"The Three Body Problem is a book that, for the most part, engaged my mind rather than my emotions. Funnily enough, when I started reading it I expected the opposite. It opens on a heart-wrenching scene of injustice and ideology-gone-mad set during the Cultural Revolution that had me gripped straight away and feeling for the characters. This is a feat few books achieve, so I was really impressed and eager to continue. But as I kept reading I lost some of that initial fervour. Things quickly move into the realm of odd mysteries, bizarre virtual worlds and detailed scientific explanations.

I was slow to connect with the characters because we are rarely let in on their emotions or thought processes, so it took me until at least halfway through the book to really understand them and their motivations. I think this wasn’t helped by the fact that we switched from following a character at the start who I found really interesting, Ye, to following another character, Wang, who I found less interesting, and it took a while to return to Ye and learn her full story. As a result I never felt hugely passionate about picking up the book to learn what would happen to them next.

What kept me reading, however, and what I think is the book’s greatest strength, was its fascinating scientific ideas and “what if” scenarios. There is some really out-there stuff that pushes the boundaries of our understanding of what might be possible, much of it unique and mindbendingly bizarre and creative. I must confess, I didn’t understand about 60% of the scientific explanations but that was okay because I got the general premises necessary to understanding the story. As a fan of science fiction, I was intrigued by it all. It also had some profound imagery and analogies that really stuck with me after reading... I'll remain vague so as not to give away too much, but for example there was a mention of locusts that I loved, and some of the scenes from the strange computer game that were haunting.

So if you’re into science fiction like me, and you like new and out-there ideas, you might enjoy this book. But if you’re not into the genre, or new to it, or if you're a reader who likes a lot of emotion and internal reflections from characters, this isn't one I'd recommend.

Also, if you listen to this as an audiobook, as I did, be prepared to rewind and re-listen occasionally, or focus harder than usual, because this is not a book easily understood without paying close attention.

"A very refreshing novel from a Chinese writer. As a starting point, it is interesting to read a sci-fi book that is written in China. The plot is deeply rooted in the recent history of China and includes some events in the Cultural revolution and other political/historical influences that molded modern China.

The backbone of the book is the basic sci-fi (and potential real life ) problem of
""does planet earth really want to have contact with alien cultures and societies"".

On one hand, there is the romantic vision of contact and cultural/technological cross fertilization. On the other hand, there is the danger of earth being crushed by the aliens.

The book touches some other issues like

environment and the positon of man in the world compared to other species.

Feminism

God and the place of ""good vs evil"" in our life and culture.

Pacifism.



The book did have some boring parts, but altogether this is a nice read and I recommend it to sci-fi lovers who want to experience a new perspective.

A few quotes

“Why does one have to save people to be considered a hero? Why is saving other species considered insignificant? Who gave humans such high honors? No, humans do not need saving. They’re already living much better than they deserve.”

“A woman should be like water, able to flow over and around anything.”

""Is it possible that the relationship between humanity and evil is similar to the relationship between the ocean and an iceberg floating on its surface? Both the ocean and the iceberg are made of the same material. That the iceberg seems separate is only because it is in a different form. In reality, it is but a part of the vast ocean.… It was impossible to expect a moral awakening from humankind itself, just like it was impossible to expect humans to lift off the earth by pulling up on their own hair. To achieve moral awakening required a force outside the human race.”

"(I'm not sure I will bother with formatting texts on gr anymore, when a site can't even be bothered to implement a wysiwyg text editor. If you want to see a formatted review, go to my storgraph, they are better anyway.)

I will have to eye-read this again to form a final opinion, so take this with a grain of salt. I had to rush through the book because I could only lend it for 7 days, not my usual reading speed. But I definitely liked it enough to want to read it again, more slowly, to let all the concepts sink in and mull them over in my head.

What I liked:

It started very strong, the Revolutionary Struggle Session really got to me.
All those sweet Cosmic Horror elements and moments.
I was very engaged in the ideas presented. They are interesting, out there and yet believable. Great combination.
I wanted to know how the story would progress.
Loved how the Three-Body-Problem and its eventual revelation was incorporated into the story.
The computer chapter.
The Adventists. I get them.


What I didn't like:

The pacing constantly switched between fast and slow, which made for a somewhat incoherent experience.
It had its lengths.
There was so much exposition, which is not completely unavoidable in a book like this, I guess. But as the book progressed, it got more and more and towards the end there was just so much of it I couldn't sit through another chapter of somebody explaining something to somebody else.
The aliens
, not very believable. But maybe it will be explained in one of the next books.


I am definitely going to read the 2nd book in the series.

"3.5/5

Pierwsza połowa mnie zachwyciła. Końcówka przerosła.

Wpadłam w tę historię od samego początku, byłam ciekawa bohaterów i ich historii, chciałam wiedzieć, o co chodzi i do czego to wszystko zmierza. Dawno nie czytałam czegoś równie angażującego. Niepokojąca atmosfera, zagubienie postaci, ich niewiedza związana z tajemniczą grą i badającymi ją służbami - to było świetne. Autor nie jest wirtuozem słowa, a jednak udało mu się stworzyć mroczny, osaczający nastrój, który mnie porwał. Połączenie historii Chin (nie tak znów odległej, a w dużej mierze zupełnie nam jednak obcej) z kulturą szeroko rozumianego zachodu i wciągnięcie w to elementów socjologii, filozofii i religii bardzo mi się podobało. Śledzenie losów postaci - od astrofizyczki nawiązującej kontakt z obcymi, przez naukowca grającego w dziwaczną grę komputerową, aż po twardo stąpającego po ziemi policjanta z wojskową przeszłością - było naprawdę zajmujące. Schody zaczęły się, gdy przenieśliśmy się na Trisolaris, ale tego mogłam się spodziewać. Geniuszem fizycznym nie byłam i już nigdy nie będę, a biorąc pod uwagę fakt, że w liceum jechałam na dwójach wstawianych za piękne oczy, sama jestem w szoku, że w ogóle przebrnęłam przez finał tej książki. Czy coś z niego zrozumiałam? To już insza inszość, więc przemilczmy ten temat.

Kiedyś pewnie z ciekawości sięgnę po drugi tom, ale jest to przyszłość bliżej niesprecyzowana i raczej mi do niej nieśpieszno.

"The beginning of this book can be confusing, it starts with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which had me so confused to where the book is getting at by adding this piece of history. It is relevant to the story of course and starts a chain of events and reactions from some of the main characters.

Then we jump forty odd years ahead, and strange things are going on in the scientific community and the main character, Wang Miao is thrown into things he has no grasp over. This part is where I knew I couldn't put the book down, it had me so curious about these strange events. Definitely this is where the atmosphere of the book changes from gloomy to a fever dream. There is a game within the book, and some parts are of the game-play, not my favorite part at times but amusing and interesting at others.

Throughout the book there a sense of a great thematic undercurrent that really resonated with me. Of people doing what they can with the information provided. There are many aspects of this story, and a multitude of sides with more perspectives to add to the story. It really added to my liking of the book, the author so carefully constructed

It is science heavy, a lot of concepts are explored and explained which can make this book tough to get through if that isn't your thing. Lots of computer science, a lot more physics concepts that I hardly grasped at, and some fictional science is added in.

"I’ve not enjoyed a sci-fi novel so much in years! What a fantastic start to a trilogy and I cannot wait to see how it develops from here… The story is a blend of hard sci-fi, mystery, and even historical fiction; the novel’s beginning is set during China’s Cultural Revolution and examines the oppression faced by scientists and intellectuals. What follows, sometime in the near-future, seems quite at odds with this opening, but I urge you to stay open-minded, even as the plot and ideas grow more and more surreal. This a definitely a slow burn, and there is a whole lot of plot and a whole lot science to get through, before you start seeing how it links together. I can’t say how accurate any of the science is, or how plausible any of the events are (not very, I’m guessing?), but this really didn’t bother me and I enjoyed the ride immensely. In the second half, in particular, the pages flew by and I really couldn't put it down. If I had one hope for the sequels, it would be that Liu can improve on the characterisation. This felt like a novel where the numerous characters were definitely secondary to the plot developments. Having said that, I loved this imaginative epic and I’m excited for whatever comes next!

"„Трите тела“ от Лиу Цъсин е първи том от нашумялата трилогия „Земното минало“, считана за научнофантастичен шедьовър с монументална визия. Преводът от китайски е дело на Стефан Русинов. Художник на корицата: Виктория Стайкова.

След кратка ретроспекция „Трите тела“ ни връща в началото на XXI век, когато поредица от необясними физични явления карат много учени да се усъмнят в самите основи на науката, а някои от тях – да отнемат живота си. В опит да разнищят мистерията разработчикът на наноматериали Уан Мяо и циничният, но ефикасен полицай Да Шъ попадат на странна компютърна игра на име „Трите тела“, която показва живота на непозната планета в звездна система с непредсказуеми природни закони. Всичко това е свързано с дейността на тайна радиоастрономическа станция през мрачните години на Културната революция, когато низвергнатата астрофизичка Йе Уън-дзие попада в центъра на събитие, което ще изправи човечеството пред най-голямото изпитание в историята му.

Китайският писател фантаст Лиу Цъсин (р. 1963 г.) израства във времената на Културната революция, описвани от мнозина негови съвременници като „епоха без книги“, завършва хидроинженерство и работи по специалността си, преди да започне да пише през осемдесетте години на миналия век, повлиян от твърдата научна фантастика на Артър Кларк, но и от реализма на Лев Толстой. Рекордьор по получени награди „Галактика“, които отбелязват най-доброто в китайската фантастика, той придобива световна известност през 2015 г., когато става първият азиатски лауреат на „Хюго“, най-престижната награда за научнофантастична литература, присъдена му за първата част от трилогията „Земното минало“ – „Трите тела“. През 2018 г. е удостоен с наградата „Артър Кларк“ за въображение в служба на обществото.

"I ended up being very impressed with this one.

It’s a sci-fi that puts science in the foreground and doesn’t apologize for doing that. The story is very well paced and really feels like a true sci-fi novel with cutting edge science, characters with true risk and great pacing.

A few negatives:
- the characters were sort of flat in the story with not many sticking out in particular. They were good characters just fell somewhat flat to me.
- this is a confusing book for some and I definitely understand! It confuses you and twists and turns. I ultimately enjoyed the ride but I get why some don’t.


I highly recommend it overall, this is a stunning sci-fi and I’m headed to watch the show! 👀

Los conceptos detrás del libro son extremadamente interesantes y me gusta como incorpora tramas políticas, religiones, ciencia y tecnología para ir creando este mundo.
Mi parte favorita del libro fue, sin duda alguna, el juego El Problema de los Tres Cuerpos, no niego que me gustaría jugar un juego así (aunque admito que probablemente no llegaría muy lejos).
Mi única queja es el estilo de escritura, se siente demasiado simple para un libro de ciencia ficción dura como este y contrasta mucho cuando aparecen conceptos de física cuántica o de ingeniería.

Wow. Cixin Liu just transformed pure science into a novel. I am speechless. I have never read anything like this before and with a good reason- I do not know how to read science.

This was so unlike anything I have read before. I've only just begun dipping my toes in the vast sea of what SciFi has to offer, having traditionally preferred fantasy. This book shows the potential of the genre: truly anything can happen. I went into this book knowing nothing about it other than that it was made into a popular show and had won the Hugo award. Even a third of the way in I didn't have the slightest clue where it would go; every chapter was a revelation. It was very technical in places when discussing the math and science sides, but never in a dry way. The characters, though intriguing, were not people I feel strongly for; it was definitely a book that engaged my mind more than my heart, which is not a bad thing at all.

I am eager to get my hands on more by this author!

"In the People’s Republic of China 1967, it was a time where the Cultural Revolution was purging the country of all capitalist ideals. A group of scientists, part of a secret military project, send signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien race on the brink of destruction known as the Trisolarans capture the signal and now plan to invade earth. A deeply philosophical game The Three-Body Problem occupies the mind of many scientist which features a world with three suns, causing chaos and unpredictability; trying to understand the order is what motives these people. The Three-Body Problem is a first contact novel often referred to as a cross between Dune and Independence Day.

The Cultural Revolution makes for an interesting backdrop for this novel and I feel an understanding is essential to the story. The Cultural Revolution was a social-political movement that was set in motion by Chairman Mao to transform The People’s Republic of China into the true Communist ideal. This was a cultural purging to remove all remnants of capitalism and to some extent even getting rid of some of China’s traditional elements. The movement ran from 1966 to 1976, although Chairman Mao did declare it over in 1969, but the Red Guard were still very active in their mission all the way till the death of their military leader Lin Biao.

This was also during the height of the space race, Sputnik was the first artificial satellite to be launched into space in 1957, giving the Soviet Union an early lead. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) is believed to have begun in the late 1950s, although their research into rockets were more focused on a ballistic missile program to help defend the country against the Americans and Soviets during the cold war. However China was still interested in space exploration and their first spacecraft to hold human occupancy, Shuguang-1, was designed in 1968.

Now, a three-body problem in physics, is a scientific process where you take initial data sets (position, masses, velocities, etc.) and determine the motion of the three bodies with the help of the laws of classical mechanics, such as Newton’s laws of motion. Historically the three specific bodies being studied were the Moon, the Earth and the Sun. This ties the title of the novel back to the space race and also predicting the world found in the game The Three-Body Problem. However this is only the beginning of trying to understand the workings of this novel and I have not even touched on the philosophical or social criticism aspects of The Three-Body Problem.

The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin won the Hugo award recently for ‘Best Novel’ and I found it to be an intriguing plot idea. I knew I had to read this, and I went in expecting something similar to Russian science fiction, where there was a lot of social commentary of what was happening within Communist China. This novel did not disappoint, I would compare this to the Russian first contact novel Roadside Picnic in the way it explored social and scientific ideals but then the philosophical elements remind me of the old sci-fi novels from the 1960s.

Special mention needs to be made to Ken Liu who did an excellent job of translating this book into English. I found myself looking forward to reading all his translation notes which explains historical and cultural references that Westerners like myself may not have known about. I also appreciate that he did not try to convert the narrative to a more accessible format but allowed outsiders a taste in the narrative structure found in Chinese books. I was really impressed with the first book in the Remembrance of Earth’s Past trilogy and I would like to think I would read the rest of the series, but I know what I am like when it comes to finishing a series.

"It's been a while since I've whipped out a five star review, but this fella I think might just have made the cut.

It's bold science fiction writing that makes me remember why I love science (and fiction).

You could level a few criticisms at it for sure: It's preposterous to the extreme; the characters are a little 2 dimensional.

But the world the author creates is just so damn mesmerising, fascinating, inspiring, nourishing. A michelin star meal for the mind. I could not put it down.

Excited to read 2 and 3 now.

Overall rating for the trilogy: 3 star

It was announced last Saturday that Liu Cixin's The Three-body Problem was the winner of 2015 Hugo Awards Best Novel. For the last two days, the wave of praises and celebrations has swept across Weibo, the biggest Chinese micro-blogging site. I feel I must write a review.

Liu Cixin is probably the most well-known and well-celebrated Chinese science fiction writer. I've read almost all his writings. He is good at mixing Chinese social, political and historical elements with hard sci-fi elements. One of my favorites is a short story about how a dying physics teacher from a very poor and remote school saved the earth from being blown up by aliens. It is a touching story that blends China's traditional belief of education into a science fiction. It also raises concerns of the living condition of rural substitute school teachers who generally worked on very low salary with no pension and slim hope for promotion.

The first book, Once Upon a Time on the Earth, was published in 2008. It was said to be the best Liu Cixin and the best Chinese science fiction. I enjoyed it very much despite some minor disappointments. The second and third book are increasingly less interesting. Let me cut it short, here is what I like and don't like about the books:



What I like:

1. Again, the writer has done a good job in blending Chinese history, such as the Cultural Revolution, into a science fiction. I must say the historical part is my favorite.

2. Some very nice science stuff. Evidently, the three body problem is real and it remains unsolved to date. I also like the game play narration, very imaginative.

3. It's a completed doomsday novel. Although I find its ending disturbing, it's consistent and fulfilled. All questions are answered. It does not fall into anything supernatural or religious like some science fictions would do.

What I don't like:

1. The writing.

There are holes in the plot. It feels rushed in the several places. Characters are mostly two-dimensional with a few exceptions. The female characters are among the worst ones I've ever read in science fictions. Ye Wenjie, a victim-turned-cold-devil, so unlikable and unconvincing. Chen Xin, a beautiful, gentle young woman who is given the ultimate power because she somehow represents the traditional female value. The writer's purpose for creating this character is to prove his philosophical idea - the Dark Forest Rule. However, he fails to make her a full-bodied human woman. Instead, he stereotypes her into a foolish barbie doll.

2. The writer tries to achieve too much and he succeeds less. He intends to implement in his book a set rules for civilisations' development and survival, but those rules are not original nor have been made convincing by the writer. For example, the book says:

(1) A civilisation's first and most need is survival

(2) The growth of technology is not linear.

(3) Because of (1) and (2), the most possible reaction of one civilisation on discovering another, is to launch a deadly attack in the dark.

Really? I do not agree with (1), neither can I logically deduct (3) from (1) and (2).

Let me quote Arthur C. Clark from his Rendezvous with Rama:

""The human race has to live with its conscience. Whatever the Hermians argue, ""

I totally understand why this book is so popular in China. It fits into the popular belief that you must do everything to win because the winner takes it all and the loser is wiped out. An example of self-fulfilling prophecy, is it not?

Begininning against a backdrop of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and spanning to modern day, The Three-Body Problem is a hard science fiction book that asks some difficult questions about humanity and its behavior over the past century.

The was originally written in Chinese and so has been translated into English. The translator, Ken Liu, makes a note at the end of the book regarding the difficulties in translating this book as there are different narrative expectations between the two cultures. Knowing this did make the parts of the book that were a little more difficult to get through more bearable.

This book was just so dry! There was a heavy focus on the science presented. Pages and pages of scientific exposition. While this is kind of expected in a science fiction book, it was so detailed that for someone that who might optimistically say that they have a very basic grasp of physics it got a point where I just couldn't follow along at all and just hoped for a summary of what it all meant at the end of the scene.

While there was a lot of attention to detail on the science side of things, there was almost no characterization at all. Da Shi an Ye Wenjie were just about the only characters that I felt like had any sort of personality at all. The character with whom we spend the most time, Wang Miao, has about the same personality as wet cardboard.

Knowing that there are different expectations in narratives in Chinese culture though, it is hard to fault the book at all for the focus on the plot/science rather than the characters. If this is what is what the intended reader looks for in a science fiction story, then I have no doubt that it blew them away. In an odd way, while this made the book a little more difficult to get through, it was also fascinating to consider the differences between Chinese and Western tastes in literature.

In that same vein, the story having such a focus on the Chinese Cultural Revolution was also fascinating. I know next to nothing about Chinese history so while I knew that the Cultural Revolution was a thing, everything else presented in the story was entirely new.

One of the things that made the book hard to get through though was not knowing for most of the book exactly where this was all going. The synopsis says something about an alien invasion but all the information given in the story for quite a bit into it does not look like it at all. There is a bunch of facts and “clues” that make no sense at all until reveals about 2/3rd.

When those reveals do come in the story gets . And that is all there is to say on that. :)

While the style of narrative and the focus on science rather than characters moving the plot forward made it a little hard to get through at times, The Three-Body Problem's examination of humanity and its behavior in the past century and whether or not we should continue to have faith in it was incredibly thought-provoking.

The VR video game chapters were easily my favorite of this series. I had a bit of trouble with it at times just because it stretched my imagination a little thin at time (like the human computer...) but overall I really enjoyed the concepts that it presented.

I am not sure if I will continue this series or not. I am interested in seeing where it all goes but I was pretty worn down by the heavy exposition structure of the story. If nothing else, this book has inspired me to make reading more Chinese history more of a priority.

"For the majority of this book I was thinking this would be a 3-star read for me, but the very end bumped up the rating to 4. He really sticks the landing. It also reminds me of Ancillary Justice where the first 80% of the book is necessary set-up so you can understand the climax. At the time you're wondering why all of this stuff is important and then at the end you go, ""Ohhh, I get it now.""

I agree with a lot of people who say that the characters are not fully realized, but that's of secondary concern to me in books like these where the idea is paramount. It would be nice if the characters were more developed, but that would merely be a bonus. The lack is not really a detriment for me.

Part of the problem is probably the fact that one of the main characters is emotionally vacant. She has lived through China's Cultural Revolution where she witnessed the murder of her father amidst the dissolution of society as a whole, so she's disconnected from her feelings. This explains her actions later in the story, and her ennui sets up the first contact with the alien Trisolarans. People often say that one person can't change the world despite all the evidence we have to the contrary, and in this case Ye's disillusionment with humanity directly informs her decision to invite the potential destruction of the human race.

We see this everyday when people become cynical due to the endless stream of bad news we see in the media. Psychologists call this ""Scary World Syndrome"" and it often leads to despair. Humans seem especially susceptible to groupthink, where we are influenced unduly by those around us. The likelihood of divorce increases based on the number of your friends who have gotten divorced. Copycat killings are frequent. Suicide can be catching. In fact, China is currently experiencing a wave of suicides among young women like Ye. Perhaps ""tsunami"" is a better term. So many women kill themselves each year in China that they comprise 25%-28% of the total suicides globally. In the 21st century alone so many Chinese women have committed suicide that it would depopulate a city the size of Chicago, which has 2.7 million people.

So there's something in the air in China, and the character of Ye reflects that. It's hard to become emotionally attached to someone like that. However, her personality is absolutely necessary to set things in motion.

That said, the book is not depressing. Especially the end, where Da Shi, the world-weary cynical cop -- who heretofore has been alternately amused and disgusted by human beings -- offers a glimmer of hope against the seemingly overwhelming odds facing humanity.

In discussions about the book many readers think the science is preposterous, but to me the stuff shown is reminiscent of the Big Idea science fiction of previous eras. Maybe unravelling a proton into higher dimensions to turn it into a computer is impossible, but then so is the Ringworld, so is everything in Star Trek, so is much of the stuff in . If we throw out all the stories where the science isn't absolutely rigorous, then we'd have precious few SF stories left.

I enjoyed the big ideas here. I liked the people fighting against the tide of cynicism. I loved the ending.

"4.5 stars

This is an adult Science Fiction story translated from the author's native language. This story's main plot is the classic sci-fi dilemma - humans making contact with alien life - but is so much more than that because of the culture, history, and hard science that is also weaved into the story.

The story opens up following a young woman, named Ye Wenjie, during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. After watching her scientist father beaten to death by revolutionaries, she is sent off to a labor camp for reeducation. By chance, she is given the opportunity to work at a top secret government organization that is looking for extraterrestrial life. The story then changes perspective to follow a young man, Wang Miao, who is a nanotech scientist. He is grabbed by the cops and taken to a secret, military meeting where they are discussing fighting some unknown enemy that is destroying human science and technology by killings scientist or driving them to suicide. Wang then goes undercover and begins playing this virtual reality game called The Three-Body Problem that seems to be connected with these mysterious murders and deaths. The game is supposedly one that only the most brilliant scientific minds can even begin to hope to beat.

My favorite thing about this story was how well-grounded it was in hard science. As someone who is currently studying physics, it was absolutely amazing to read this fictional story that had many facts and hard sciences in it. It made it feel like it wasn't a fictional story; it made it feel like it could be real.

I also really enjoyed that this story raised a lot of general and moral questions: do we really to make contact with another intelligent lifeform? If you had the chance, would you sacrifice the human race? Is science truly objective? Is the science that we know, true hard facts, or is it just what we know with our limited understanding of four spatial dimensions?

This story was incredible in many ways, but unfortunately, the one way I felt it fell short was with its characters. There were a lot - which I generally like - but many of them felt like cardboard cutouts whose only purpose was to further the plot instead of being unique individuals. There were also times where these characters would go on rants, giving the other characters in the story and the reader a lot of information at once, which only added to them not feeling like real people, because people don't talk and converse like that.
(It reminded me of when I play video games and I come across this character in the game whose sole purpose is to tell me some information that will get me to the next quest or plot point in the game's story)
Our two main characters, Ye Wenjie and Wang Miao, almost felt like side characters. More specifically Wang Miao. The story seemed to be happening independently of Wang Miao's actions. Looking back on the story, I find myself questioning what he actually in the book. I'm not sure if all of this is due, in part, to this being a translated work but that was not super fun.

Despite that though, this story is definitely one of the most mind-blowing stories I have ever read - plot-wise. It is so compelling and imaginative and . I think if you like big ideas and speculative fiction based in hard science than you will really enjoy this read as I did.

"Somewhat mixed feelings on this one. The concept and setting was really unique and interesting, but it's quite a slow build and I found it difficult to really get into. I never fully connected with any of the characters or their motivations -- this felt closer to hard sci-fi than the character driven sci-fi that I much prefer. I was engaged enough in the overarching plot that I do plan to read the next book, and I'm curious about the Netflix adaptation, but I wasn't as obsessed with this one as I wanted to be.

"""What the ****?"" - Inner Review

""Spectacularly boring!"" - Not the Best of Times

""So much potential and it just imploded halfway!"" - Negativity Journal

Those are probably how I can summarize this book. So, without further ado, let's go straight forward to why I really really dislike this book. SPOILER ALERT BTW!

1. Show, do NOT Tell!
The basis of every good story is that we, as the readers, are emotionally involved with the plight of the characters. And the best way to do that is to show the readers what the characters go through. The adversity. The inner emotional conflict. None of that happened in this book. Most of the time, the author just seemed to skip a significant period of time and picked it up later when another character is telling the main characters what just happened during the skipped period. Boring!

2. Inconsistent format
The first half of the book was okay, in my opinion. It was written like a decent mystery novel with credible science fiction backgrounds. BUT!
.
Then, somehow the author managed to write it in the format of interview questions, boring scientific paper, boring police case paperwork, some imaginary conversation someone dreamed of. In essence, after the halfway point, everything just didn't make sense. It got disconnected. Like the second half of the story didn't belong in this book.

3. I just don't give a **** about the characters
With the idea as big as it was in this book, the emotional conflict should've been as enormous as the Mount Everest. But, the most emotional conflicting point passed just like that (
). Frustrating! The story could've been so so so much better written.

Now, having said that, the only reason I didn't give this book a 1-star is because I think the speculative science concepts introduced in this book, to me at the very least, seem plausible. I think the author did some exhaustive research into most of the concepts. There are one or two concepts that I thought was ""impossible"", in my opinion (
), but for the most part the scientific concepts explained in the book were interestingly speculative. However, they're presented in the book like in a scientific paper. So ... boring!

I also don't know how the translation may have affected (or not) the quality of the original story written in Mandarin. Since, I don't read Mandarin (not anymore unfortunately), I can't judge it.

As much as I'd love to give this book a higher rating, considering it's rare to have a science fiction book written by an Asian rated so highly, I just couldn't like this book. And yes, I'm not interested to read the reminder of the series, because I just don't give a **** about what's gonna happen to the characters.

"It was impossible to expect a moral awakening from humankind itself, just like it was impossible to expect humans to lift off the earth by pulling up on their own hair. To achieve moral awakening required a force outside the human race.
This thought determined the entire direction of Ye's life.

Chinese scientists try to contact alien civilizations in the 60s/70s, and a lot of things don't go as planned. A lot of very smart people try to figure out very important problems, and there's also a bad cop smoking cigars and being mean, for some reason.

And then there's way, . And maths. If it takes 300 pages of trying to understand solar radiation, complicated astrophysical equations and nanoparticles to get to the aliens, I've probably already stopped caring about the aliens. But to be fair I was always bad at physics in school, so maybe it's my own fault that I could get hardly through these parts.

The writing is - well, it's a translation from a language I have no experience with, so I don't know who I can actually blame here. Maybe it sounds better in Chinese, but in English it's just boring and repetitive. Short sentence. Another short sentence. And another short sentence. Almost everything is told to the characters by someone else. Not much actually happens. And then there's probably another long scientific explanation, which I don't even want to try to understand anymore.

I couldn't really sympathize with any of these characters either, because none of them seemed to have any empathy or any feelings in general (
). Wang, one of the main characters, has a wife and a son, and he doesn't think about them at all. They show up once, do nothing that is relevant for the plot, and then he just seems to forget about them for the rest of the time. Another person someone they care about, seemingly without ever regretting it or wondering if maybe there could've been another way to solve the problem.

There's not even much to say about the aliens, once they finally show up. The physics of their world might be detailed (very, very detailed), but everything else about their culture is pretty unimaginative. They're just humans with a different name, and .

This kind of dark, bland science fiction really isn't my thing, without any likeable characters, and alien civilizations that might as well be humans living on another planet.

No me resulta nada fácil empezar la reseña de un libro como este, por eso he decidido hacerlo con un párrafo de la propia novela. Porque de ideas y preguntas como estas está llena, ideas para reflexionar y para crecer dentro de una historia apabullante, de un viaje apasionante por la historia de China, de la Revolución Cultural a nuestros días, incluso al futuro, con la Ciencia como hilo conductor.
'El Problema de los tres cuerpos' es alta literatura de género, una hard sci-fi que hará las delicias de todos los que amamos el género. Liu Cixin, con un intimidante conocimiento de la física y un abrumador poder imaginativo, sabe entrelazar maravillosamente la Ciencia y la ficción, para entretejer una trama repleta de ideas alucinantes, donde lo que más importa es precisamente eso, las ideas, la historia, lo que sugiere, en detrimento de los personajes, que, sin llegar a estar descuidados, sí que están un poco más en segundo plano, siendo un mero elemento más para poder contar aquello que el autor quiere.
Siempre me ha gustado más hablar de ficción científica que de ciencia ficción, y en esta ocasión no tengo ninguna duda. En esta obra lo importante es la Ciencia, enmarcada en un contexto mitad histórico mitad ficticio y que llega a adentrarse en terrenos de la fantaciencia y la especulación, pero siempre con una base de conocimiento y dominio de las teorías que hace recapacitar hasta al más ducho en la materia.
Considero que esta novela es exigente incluso para los que acostumbramos a leer scifi, pero es tan sumamente entretenida y sugerente, que animo a todo aquel que tenga un mínimo de interés por estos temas a que le de una oportunidad, seguramente no se arrepentirá.
Es evidente que la novela me ha encantado, diré mas, entra directamente en mi top-10 de lo mejor que he leído nunca ya sea de género o no, y me siento afortunada de que, encima, esta sea el inicio de una trilogía cuyas dos partes restantes llegarán a España en 2017. Masco mi propia ansia.
Años atrás fueron los detectives nórdicos y las fantasías medievales británicas los que deslumbraban al mundo, ahora ha llegado la hora de los escritores chinos de SciFi. Me froto las manos.

Nu ir man patiko, ir ta teorija nebuvo nuobodi, kartais net eidavau pažįstamų fizikų pasiklausti, kas tas tokio yra. Nors ir trumpai paminėta, bet kosminio lifto sukūrimo prielaidos yra, kas mane nustebino, ir kodėl jis nesukuriamas man irgi šiek tiek leido suprasti ar tiesiog įsivaizduoti apie ką kalba. Smulkmena, bet visgi. Šita dalis kaip ir ok :) kita dalis yra ateivių įsivaizdavimas. Darom prielaidą, kad ateiviai bent kažkiek panašūs į žmones, tarkim turi emocijas, ir čia būtent tas scenarijus, kai tu dar iš principo gali priešintis. Čia jau knygos siužetas nebestebina, tiesiog gerai išvystytas, įtemptas kur reikia, pakankamai seklus ir čia jau važiuojam su tais, kurie teorijos neraukia. Nors kalbant apie kitas gyvybės formas ir kiek jos gali skirtis nuo mūsų supratimo, man labiau patiko ""soliaris"", bet sci-fi skaitau mažai, tai nelabai daugiau galiu ir lyginti. Bet ""Trijų kūnų problemą,"" užskaitau, įsitraukiau ir dabar dar noriu sužinot, o kas gi nutiko su ""trijų kūnų problemos"" sprendimu? Ar čia tik toks periodinis pasirodymas?

"What should one expect from ""hard"" science fiction? Is it just a vehicle for the qualitative examination of natural and social phenomena? Just a venue for commentary and synthesis? Or do we expect a serious work of genre literature to also be... well... literary fiction?

If the answer to that final question is yes, I fear that Cixin's is decidedly deficient. It is a stark work without meaningful character development. Most characters are skeletal, asking the reader to rely on stereotype or historical context to put flesh on the bone, and although I of course read this in translation, it seems reasonable to posit that Cixin's prose craft is not particularly notable (e.g. stilted and cliched dialogue). The narrative structure seems in the mold of Vonnegut's (much less elaborate), but I don't see how it is justified or anchored (Some writing suggests the editorial process may have contributed to the structure because of the politically sensitive content). Moreover, I found the most compelling aspects of the narrative to be Wang's virtual reality escapades, which ironically contain tons of exposition. This throws into sharp relief the quality of the narrative friction generated by the purportedly more kinetic aspects of the novel.

However, if we answer that interesting ideas and provocative commentary are enough to sustain a great hard Sci-Fi piece, then maybe is an impressive work. I say maybe because I worry that some of the ideas are muddled or that Cixin might be flippant or just takes unwarranted liberties with the content. I admire Cixin's effort to marshal ideas from disparate scientific and historical bodies of knowledge into the plot of novel, but it is unclear if the ideas are actually substantive or how they work to produce a coherent novel with a particular perspective. It is also the case that there are probably too many ideas packed in. I fear the work is unfocused and likely a bit sloppy with the titular idea (i.e. the three-body problem), but it is unclear to me. Some of this of course is Cixin is working with esoteric and complex ideas, and I should work harder as a reader to master the content raised so as to evaluate with greater accuracy.

Cixin's invests in exploring the dynamics of humanity's promethean and millenarian impulses in an Eastern context (i.e. communist modern China). If there is a central preoccupation of the work, it appears to be the seductive and chaotic threat both those instincts pose to a ""middle path"" (madhyamaka) lifestyle. Could Cixin's fiction actually be subversive to ends of ""the party"" or is he just a clever court jester?

"El problema de los tres cuerpos es la primera entrega de una trilogía de ciencia ficción ""dura"" escrita por Liu Cixin y publicada en 2006. La novela se popularizó casi diez años después, tras ganar el premio Hugo en 2015. La trama abarca una extensa temporalidad, mezclando un contexto real con una trama futurista. Aunque muchas reseñas no parezcan abordarlo, hay una profunda inquietud política detrás y, desde mi punto de vista, el autor realiza una crítica severa al extremismo comunista durante la Revolución Cultural China. Liu Cixin utiliza el ""desprecio"" político hacia la ciencia, muy absurdo, rídiculo también, para motivar a sus protagonistas, Ye Wenjie y Wang Miao; es evidente que una de las tesis de la novela es combatir la ignorancia por medio de la difusión del conocimiento.

A mi ver, Liu Cixin tiene una prosa pedagógica. En el buen sentido. Los conceptos complicados matemáticos y físicos en su pluma son comprensibles porque se cuentan desde la pasión, como un buen maestro en sus momentos más lucidos durante una clase. Personalmente no soy un lector que conoce de física, pero nunca me sentí perdido en los momentos donde la cienca protagoniza la historia. Desde mi punto de vista, la teoría de los tres cuerpos y el interés por la realidad virtual, entre otras cosas, complementan de manera extraordinaria a la historia.

La narración es inquieta, fascinante a su manera. Hay tres tramas, aunque solo me gustaría hablar de las evidentes porque parte del encanto de esta novela es desconocer los giros argumentales que se suceden a lo largo de los capítulos. Ye Wenjie es el personaje más importante de la novela. Las digresiones filosóficas más potentes de la novela derivan de las ideas de esta mujer. Realmente duré varias semanas pensando en su dilema: los seres humanos han acabado con el planeta, ¿pero merecen ser destruidos por una conciencia superior? Me gusta cómo el narrador realmente contrapone las dos visiones de sus protagonistas: por un lado, We Wenjie busca venganza contra la humanidad; por otro, Wang busca a toda costa salvar a la humanidad. Claro, rumbo al final de la novela la historia parece aguardar epicidad y angustia. Personalmente pienso que la historia es tan buena que se le perdona al narrador sus personajes acartonados y estereotípicos. El autor tiene ciertas limitaciones —por ejemplo, la estructura de la novela resulta extraña para mí; también sus flashbacks a veces se sienten forzados. Su prosa no está tan a la altura de sus ambiciones, pero las cosas que hace bien son extraordinarias y, repito, la trama de la novela es muy interesante. No hay, en fin, ningún momento aburrido.

"Potser la novel·la que he llegit amb més hype en molt de temps. Justificat?
El cas és que durant bona part de la lectura m'he emprenyat amb Liu Cixin i la seva manera de narrar els prolegòmens d'una invasió extraterrestre. Bàsicament perquè la historia va de banda a banda i muda constantment. Comença com un relat de la Xina comunista a l'estil d'una distòpia retrospectiva. Després passa a un relat d'espionatge paracientífic. S'endinsa en la temàtica pseudofantàstica amb la inclusió d'un videojoc de realitat virtual. Hi ha incursions tant a la novel·la a l'estil Tom Clancy com a la de prospecció d'Arthur C. Clarke. Quan t'acostumes a un tipus de narració, ja te l'ha canviat. I a més hi va incloent fragments de ciència-ficció hard que requereixen molta fe per part del lector.
Cap al tercer quart, la novel·la se'm queia de les mans.
I, tot i així, tinc ganes d'acabar de llegir la trilogia. Per alguna raó que no m'explico, el balanç general és positiu. Vista en perspectiva, m'ha agradat (amb alguns detalls que em molesten, però que són perdonables).
Ara bé, em sorgeixen alguns dubtes (que inclouen spòilers, obviament):
El propòsit del videojoc dels tres sols és un pèl patillero, no? Realment no té massa sentit més enllà de l'excusa de pretendre reclutar gent per la causa (ehem) amb un videojoc que, siguem francs, és avorrit de collons. Serveix per aportar una mica de fantasia i sentit de la meravella a la novel·la, en constrat a la grisor del present.
El tema dels nanofilaments que s'usen per aturar el vaixell al canal de Panamà. Ja. Sí. Clar. Busques deus ex machina al diccionari i et surt aquesta escena.
Els personatges no tenen comportaments gaire lògics, oi? Són com part de l'engranatge i prou. Una eina per a la història, no els protagonistes.
Els extraterrestres parlen com buròcrates d'una multinacional. De fet, es comporten de forma més humana que els humans.
Tota la part del (Carlos Ruiz) Sofrón. Algú l'ha entès? No pillo res. Tots aquelles figures geomètriques flotant al voltant de Trisolaris. Perdoni? Què? Va, d'acord, compro perquè ja s'estava acabant la novel·la.
I literàriament és funcional. Justeta. No està mal escrita, però no és cap meravella. De cara a barraca.

Una proposta de cara a la segona part (que ens estalviaria la tercera): habitants de la Terra, teniu 400 anys per construir una teranyina de nanofilaments i posar-la en òrbita. Així, quan arribin les naus dels trisolarians (que tenen nom de xandall de Decathlon), quedaran ben esquarteradets com els paios de Cube.

"I think I am going to stop rating books on Goodreads and just stick to reviews. The books I have read this year have been so varied in their scope and writing styles that I think it's unfair to measure them on a similar rating scale. Hence, the three star rating for the Three body problem is in no way indicative of its value. The book was quite interesting and I always love sci-fi novels where the science is explained well! Liu Cixin has done a good job of explaining the physics which drives the book forward. I come from a science background, but I am sure that even a layman will be able to comprehend it.

has the cultural revolution in China as its trigger point. I read Jung Chang's recently which I think is an excellent first-hand account of someone living in Mao's China. So, even though Cixin doesn't go into details about the revolution, I had good context about the anti-intellectual fervor of the period. The story starts with Ye Wenjie, an astrophysics graduate, witnessing her father beaten to death by the Red Guards. Ostracized politically and isolated from her family, Ye lands herself at a secret Chinese Government initiative - Red Coast. The story takes off from there and the three-body problem (mechanical system) fits in quite well into the story. I don't want to put in any spoilers, so I will not elaborate further on the plot.

The book is smart, and wide in its scope. It's a good mix of philosophy and sci-fi and addresses some interesting problems facing humanity today. However, I did feel that the language was a bit stunted (maybe because it was a translation) and the flow could have definitely been better! Also, it had so many ideas that some of them were getting lost. I do plan to read the next two books in the series as I believe that such kind of novels stand better as series than stand-alone books.

To all those who do enjoy this sort of reading, I would suggest Isaac Asimov's . I remember being astounded by its depth when I read it around 5 years back and the books remains till date my most loved sci-fi novels.

"This book is not easy. For starters, Chinese is a very different language and is very hard to translate. So much of the style would, unfortunately, be lost in translation.

Also, its is imbibed with Chinese culture and references which us in the western world wouldn't even notice.

Many of the reviews I've seen didn't really analyse the book; who gave it 2 stars on the claim that it was flat-dimensional on a story and character development level, and who gave it 5 stars claiming it was a masterpiece.

I'm in the middle. Taking into accounts the differences I quoted in the beginning, I can say that yes, if you're gonna look for sympathetic characters and stories, probably this is not the best book to read.
Also, some defined this hard-SF; while this might be the closest definition, it's not quite accurate.

The Three Body problem introduces the scene for a much larger thinking; it's almost philosophical in its evolution. If you're familiar with Plato and ""The Republic"", you'll know that in philosophy it takes a great deal of time to get to the point of the discussion, because before tackling the heart of the problem, one needs to be on common ground.

So this book it's just the beginning of the real idea that's gonna flourish in the second part of the Trilogy, called The Dark Forest; you will need to go through this book to set up the scene for the next one.

To be honest, I have a background in physics, currently work in technology, and am a huge fan of literature and Sci-Fi. I think Liu Cixin is gonna be remembered as the man who invented Cosmic Sociology. So if you wanna tell your kids you've read him, start with this, but don't be afraid to skip scenes and skim through the text. It was meant to appeal to Chinese readers. What matters here really is the message, and the message will come to full fruition only with the Dark Forest.

Once I finished this book I awaited for the sequel, the said Dark Forest. The first 100 pages of Dark Forest are, again, a bit challenging to follow with passion; but after that, everything makes sense, and you will think that Liu Cixin is a goddamn genius.
Because he is.

So, if you want to be part of history in the making, read this book; because one day we'll talk about Liu Cixin and his Cosmic Sociology as the forefather of one of the future sciences of Humanity as the race that inhabits the Solar System.

"Terrible book from every aspect.

The only good thing about this book is its length. I would have abandoned the book if it was even a dozen pages more.

**spoilers**
The plot of this book is very simple: Communists ruin China (a fact). One of the victims finds aliens and asks them to invade the Earth and take over the entire humanity because she hates her current ruling disposition (which actually improves in a decade).

There are many irrelevant and inconsequential threads. The most significant is the title and the scientific theory of three body problem. Three body problem does not play any unique role in the book. The alien planet does not have regular seasons because it orbits around three stars. This causes unstable climate and the inhabitants face complete annihilation of their society. There are two reasons why it is a stupid central theme 1. It is extremely unlikely that any life would beget in such environment at all. If this planet can have life then so can Mercury and Venus. 2. Something as simple as ""our parent star is turning a red giant"" or ""another large planet would collide with ours because of the orbital irregularity"" would have been sufficient for the aliens to seek another home.
Also, aliens invade Earth because their own planet is going to be destroyed is a hackneyed plot. This trope has been utilized in countless Sci-Fi stories.

The so called 'game' is another trope that the author indulges in. First of all, it is not a game. It is more like a simulation. There are no gaming elements to it. Why does this simulation even exist? The aliens/ ETO could easily make the case by writing a book which explains their situation. My guess is that the simulation element was purely introduced to give the book a more cyberpunk feel. The human computer inside the simulation etc are just laughable.

There are many needless ideas and science fantasies in the book. But the one introduced in the final chapters offends the most. The proton supercomputers and the microcosm therein have no bearing on the plot whatsoever. They could have simply introduced a sabotage element through ETO.

It's a science fiction (NOT, but let's assume). So there is not much scope to develop characters. Usually, in Sci-Fi, the science is the hero. The author needs to develop the science well. The author miserably fails to do that in this book.

I would give this book 0 stars if I could. It was a complete waste of two days I spent reading it.

"Ik heb dit boek gelezen als opdracht voor Uitgelezen, het literaire evenement van de Vooruit in Gent. Op eigen initiatief had ik het wellicht nooit vastgenomen: het ziet eruit als een science-fictionboek, en dat is het ook. Maar wat een ontdekking. Wat een fenomenaal boek. Wat een rijke, wonderlijke bron van lees- en denkplezier. Het beste is om niks over dit boek te weten als je eraan begint (zoals bij elk boek). In mijn bespreking hieronder doe ik mijn best om mijn enthousiasme te tonen zonder teveel weg te geven van de inhoud.

Het Drielichamen Probleem speelt zich af in China na de Culturele Revolutie. Er is sprake van een militaire basis op een berg: de Rode Kustbasis, waar een geheim programma van het Chinese leger wordt uitgevoerd. De hoofdpersonages zijn Ye Wenjie die op de Rode Kustbasis werkt en Wang Miao, een nanotechnoloog. Hij belandt in een game waarin de leefbaarheid van de wereld bepaald wordt door niet één, maar drie zonnen.

Het boek is ongelooflijk rijk en dens geschreven. De gemiddelde hoeveelheid informatie per bladzijde ligt ongewoon hoog. En het is heerlijk complex. Het boek verwijst geregeld naar de Chinese politiek en geschiedenis, en speelt zich af in een maatschappij waarin puur wetenschappelijke onderzoeksdaden politiek geïnterpreteerd worden. Een maatschappij die in angst leeft. Maar uiteindelijk draait het vooral rond wetenschap: fysica en astrofysica. Tegelijk gaat het boek over onze beschaving en stelt het vragen over wat beschaving is en waarvoor beschaving dient, over politiek en autocratie.

Het Drielichamen Probleem bevat enkele onvergetelijke beelden: de menselijke computer, de ruimtecountdown, de aanval op het schip in het Panamakanaal, de deeltjesversneller in de lucht, de gigantische slinger in Trisolaris.

Voor mij is dit boek een kennismaking met science fiction, maar ik vermoed dat het niveau zò hoog is dat weinige schrijvers zich met Cixin Liu kunnen meten. Cixin Liu is dan ook - lees ik - één van de grootste science-fictionschrijvers van China. Er zijn ook twee sequels op dit boek.

Het Drielichamen Probleem is - letterlijk - een ongelooflijk boek dat je gedachten over mens en maatschappij overhoop haalt, een weergaloze trip door ruimte, verleden en toekomst, een fantastische ontdekking.

"This book should have been right in my wheelhouse. I really love sci-fi when it tends to run heavier on the science end of the spectrum. There is a lot of that in this book. I only listened to the audio so I cannot comment as well as I would like to the quality of that science, but there were no obvious glaring mistakes being made that gave me pause.

The glaring mistakes weren't in the science and tech but rather in the poor characterization and wooden prose. To be fair, at least 90% of the time a translated book loses a lot in the translation. Living as an expat and being an armchair theologian, I am very aware of this. I am hoping that in the original Mandarin (or Cantonese? I didn't look it up), it isn't as bad. So I will give it a soft pass on this point.

What I cannot give a soft pass is the unbelievable nature of the characters' actions and motivations. There is one point where a list is presented of scientists who have all recently committed suicide. We are supposed to believe they have all done so because ""their science doesn't work."" There are also multiple people in this book who commit heinous crimes up to and including murder and yet there is no emotional fallback... ever. One of the primary characters is ridiculously rude over and over again to everybody with seemingly no real consequences. I could go on.

Another issue I had that others might not have is the subtle anti-religious bias in the author's worldview. This isn't some blatant Hitchins/Dawkins type stuff, and I don't think the author ever intended it at all. But there are hints here and there that makes clear how poorly the author views all religions. For example, when speaking of a group who have turned the coming aliens into a form of religion, Cixin says, ""They have a blind faith in their gods, but those gods are actually real.""

In all, I find this book, at least the English version, to be sadly lacking. I understand why awards have been heaped on it. It has just the right blend of political correctness and the appearance of intellectuality. So those who hand out such awards but don't really understand great literature are sure to love it. If you are looking to read a semi-readable book that you can then brag about to your friends... this is for you. If you truly want to enjoy a well-written science fiction novel, take a pass.
