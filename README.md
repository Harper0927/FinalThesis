**Abstract of the Thesis**

This study investigates the concept of world literature as perceived by non-professional readers, comparing it with definitions provided by Wikipedia and various scholars. By employing both distant reading and close reading methodologies, a variety of methods, including descriptive statistical analysis, sentiment analysis, and word cloud analysis, the research analyzes a multilingual dataset of book reviews to understand the preferences and perceptions of non-professional readers and further examines the dynamics of these works’ dissemination in the global market.
The findings reveal that most non-professional readers generally appreciate and agree with the world literature works defined by Wikipedia and scholars, although a few books may not be as well-received. The study highlights specific tags, such as “Classics,” “Historical,” and “School,” which are associated with higher reader appreciation and demonstrates the value of integrating sentiment analysis and word cloud visualization to uncover nuances in reader preferences. In a focused analysis of The Three-Body Problem, the study employs sentiment analysis and close reading methods to capture differences in how non-professional readers from various cultural backgrounds engage with the book. The research reveals a particular interest among readers in the macro- concepts that provoke thought and resonate emotionally.
However, limitations such as the small dataset size, missing data entries, and potential biases in book tags and sentiment analysis are acknowledged. These constraints affect the generalizability of the findings and the accuracy of sentiment analysis, especially in multilingual contexts.
Despite these challenges, the study significantly contributes to understanding world literature by offering a scientific and operational approach to analyzing reader perceptions. The findings provide valuable insights for authors aiming to create works that resonate with non-professional readers and advance the field of digital humanities by introducing new methods for large-scale literary analysis. Ultimately, this research lays a foundation for future studies to explore the evolving dynamics of world literature in a more comprehensive and nuanced manner.
